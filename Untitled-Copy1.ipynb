4. explain the law of dominance using a monohybrid cross. 5. define and design a test-cross. 6. using a punnett square, workout the distribution of phenotypic features\\nin the first filial generation after a cross between a homozygous female\\nand a heterozygous male for a single locus. 7. when a cross in made between tall plant with yellow seeds (ttyy) and\\ntall plant with green seed (ttyy), what proportions of phenotype in the\\noffspring could be expected to be (a) tall and green. (b) dwarf and green. 93 biology 8. two heterozygous parents are crossed. if the two loci are linked what\\nwould be the distribution of phenotypic features in f1 generation for a\\ndibybrid cross? 9. briefly mention the contribution of t.h. morgan in genetics. 10. what is pedigree analysis? suggest how such an analysis, can be useful. 11. how is sex determined in human beings? 12. a child has blood group o. if the father has blood group a and mother\\nblood group b, work out the genotypes of the parents and the possible\\ngenotypes of the other offsprings. 13. explain the following terms with example (a) co-dominance (b) incomplete dominance 14. what is point mutation? give one example. 15. who had proposed the chromosomal theory of the inheritance? 16. mention any two autosomal genetic disorders with their symptoms. 94 '"
