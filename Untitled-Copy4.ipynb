body.    athletes  are  responsible  for  any \\nprohibited substance or its metabolites or markers found to be present \\nin  their  samples.    accordingly,  it  is  not  necessary  that  intent,  fault, \\nnegligence  or  knowing  use  on  the  athlete’s  part  be  demonstrated  in \\norder to establish an anti-doping rule violation under article 2.1. \\n \\n2.1.2 sufficient proof of an
