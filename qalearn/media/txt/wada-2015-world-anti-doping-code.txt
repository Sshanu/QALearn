World Anti-Doping Code • 2015PURPOSE, SCOPE AND ORGANIZATION  
OF THE WORLD ANTI-DOPING PROGRAM 
AND THE CODE

The  purposes  of  the  World  Anti-Doping  Code  and  the  World 
Anti-Doping Program which supports it are: 
•  To  protect  the  athletes’  fundamental  right  to  participate  in 
doping-free  sport  and  thus  promote  health,  fairness  and 
equality for athletes worldwide, and 

•  To ensure harmonized, coordinated and effective anti-doping 
programs at the international and national level with regard 
to detection, deterrence and prevention of doping.

The Code 
The  Code  is  the  fundamental  and  universal  document  upon 
which  the  World  Anti-Doping  Program  in  sport  is  based. 
The  purpose  of  the  Code  is  to  advance  the  anti-doping  effort 
through universal harmonization of core anti-doping elements. 
it  is  intended  to  be  specific  enough  to  achieve  complete 
harmonization  on  issues  where  uniformity  is  required,  yet 
general  enough  in  other  areas  to  permit  flexibility  on  how 
agreed-upon  anti-doping  principles  are  implemented.  The 
Code has been drafted giving consideration to the principles of 
proportionality and human rights.

[Comment: The Olympic Charter and 
the International Convention against 
Doping in Sport 2005 adopted in Paris 
on 19 October 2005 (“UNESCO  
Convention”), both recognize the  
prevention of and the fight against 

doping in sport as a critical part of the 
mission of the International Olympic 
Committee and UNESCO, and also 
recognize the fundamental role of the 
Code.]

11

World Anti-Doping Code • 2015The World Anti-Doping Program 
The  World  Anti-Doping  Program  encompasses  all  of  the 
elements  needed  in  order  to  ensure  optimal  harmonization 
and  best  practice  in  international  and  national  anti-doping 
programs. The main elements are:
Level 1:  The Code
Level 2:  International Standards
Level 3:  Models of Best Practice and guidelines

International Standards
International  Standards  for  different  technical  and  operational 
areas  within  the  anti-doping  program  have  been  and  will  be 
developed in consultation with the Signatories and governments 
and  approved  by  Wada.  The  purpose  of  the  International 
Standards  is  harmonization  among  anti-doping  organizations 
responsible  for  specific  technical  and  operational  parts  of  
anti-doping programs. Adherence to the International Standards 
is  mandatory  for  compliance  with  the  Code.  The  International 
Standards  may  be  revised  from  time  to  time  by  the  Wada 
Executive  Committee  after  reasonable  consultation  with  the 
Signatories,  governments  and  other  relevant  stakeholders. 
International Standards and all revisions will be published on the 
Wada website and shall become effective on the date specified 
in the International Standard or revision.

[Comment: The International  
Standards contain much of the  
technical detail necessary for  
implementing the Code. International 
Standards will, in consultation with  
the Signatories, governments and  
other relevant stakeholders, be  

developed by experts and set forth in 
separate documents. It is important 
that the WADA Executive Committee 
be able to make timely changes to 
the International Standards without 
requiring any amendment of the Code.]

12

World Anti-Doping Code • 2015Models of Best Practice and Guidelines
Models  of  best  practice  and  guidelines  based  on  the  Code 
and  International  Standards  have  been  and  will  be  developed 
to  provide  solutions  in  different  areas  of  anti-doping.  The 
models  and  guidelines  will  be  recommended  by  Wada  and 
made available to Signatories and other relevant stakeholders, 
but  will  not  be  mandatory.  in  addition  to  providing  models  of  
anti-doping documentation, Wada will also make some training 
assistance available to the Signatories. 

[Comment: These model documents 
may provide alternatives from which 
stakeholders may select. Some 
stakeholders may choose to adopt the 
model rules and other models of best 
practices verbatim. Others may decide 
to adopt the models with modifications. 
Still other stakeholders may choose 
to develop their own rules consistent 

with the general principles and specific 
requirements set forth in the Code.

Model documents or guidelines for 
specific parts of anti-doping work have 
been developed and may continue 
to be developed based on generally 
recognized stakeholder needs and 
expectations.]

World Anti-Doping Code • 2015FUNDAMENTAL RATIONALE FOR THE 
WORLD ANTI-DOPING CODE

Anti-doping  programs  seek  to  preserve  what  is  intrinsically 
valuable about sport. This intrinsic value is often referred to as 
“the spirit of sport.” it is the essence of Olympism, the pursuit 
of human excellence through the dedicated perfection of each 
person’s  natural  talents.  it  is  how  we  play  true.  The  spirit  of 
sport is the celebration of the human spirit, body and mind, and 
is reflected in values we find in and through sport, including:
•  Ethics, fair play and honesty
•  Health
•  Excellence in performance
•  Character and education
•  Fun and joy
•  Teamwork
•  Dedication and commitment
•  Respect for rules and laws
•  Respect for self and other Participants
•  Courage
•  Community and solidarity
Doping is fundamentally contrary to the spirit of sport.
To fight doping by promoting the spirit of sport, the Code requires 
each  anti-doping  organization  to  develop  and 
implement 
education  and  prevention  programs  for  athletes,  including 
youth, and athlete Support Personnel.

World Anti-Doping Code • 2015PART ONE

DOPING CONTROL

INTRODUCTION

INTRODUCTION
Part One of the Code sets forth specific anti-doping rules and 
principles that are to be followed by organizations responsible 
for  adopting,  implementing  or  enforcing  anti-doping  rules 
within their authority, e.g., the international Olympic Committee, 
international Paralympic Committee, international Federations, 
national olympic Committees and Paralympic Committees, Major 
event organizations, and national anti-doping organizations. All 
such  organizations  are  collectively  referred  to  as  anti-doping 
organizations.
All provisions of the Code are mandatory in substance and must 
be followed as applicable by each anti-doping organization and 
athlete or  other Person. The  Code  does  not,  however,  replace 
or  eliminate  the  need  for  comprehensive  anti-doping  rules 
to  be  adopted  by  each  anti-doping  organization.  While  some 
provisions of the Code must be incorporated without substantive 
change by each anti-doping organization in its own anti-doping 
rules, other provisions of the Code establish mandatory guiding 
principles  that  allow  flexibility  in  the  formulation  of  rules  by 
each  anti-doping  organization  or  establish  requirements  that 
must be followed by each anti-doping organization but need not 
be repeated in its own anti-doping rules.
Anti-doping  rules,  like  competition  rules,  are  sport  rules 
governing  the  conditions  under  which  sport 
is  played. 
athletes or other Persons accept these rules as a condition of 
participation and shall be bound by these rules. Each Signatory 
shall establish rules and procedures to ensure that all athletes 
or  other  Persons  under  the  authority  of  the  Signatory  and 
its  member  organizations  are  informed  of  and  agree  to  be 
bound by anti-doping rules in force of the relevant anti-doping 
organizations.
Each  Signatory  shall  establish  rules  and  procedures  to 
ensure  that  all  athletes  or  other  Persons  under  the  authority 
of the Signatory and its member organizations consent to the 
dissemination  of  their  private  data  as  required  or  authorized 
by  the  Code,  and  are  bound  by  and  compliant  with  Code  
anti-doping  rules,  and  that  the  appropriate  Consequences 
are  imposed  on  those  athletes  or  other  Persons  who  are  not 

16

World Anti-Doping Code • 20151   PARTDoping Controlin conformity with those rules. These sport-specific rules and 
procedures, aimed at enforcing anti-doping rules in a global and 
harmonized way, are distinct in nature from criminal and civil 
proceedings. They are not intended to be subject to or limited 
by any national requirements and legal standards applicable to 
such proceedings, although they are intended to be applied in 
a manner which respects the principles of proportionality and 
human rights. When reviewing the facts and the law of a given 
case, all courts, arbitral hearing panels and other adjudicating 
bodies  should  be  aware  of  and  respect  the  distinct  nature  of 
the anti-doping rules in the Code and the fact that those rules 
represent the consensus of a broad spectrum of stakeholders 
around the world with an interest in fair sport.

[Comment: Those Articles of the Code 
which must be incorporated into each 
Anti-Doping Organization’s rules  
without substantive change are set 
forth in Article 23.2.2. For example,  
it is critical for purposes of  
harmonization that all Signatories 
base their decisions on the same list of 
anti-doping rule violations, the same 
burdens of proof and impose the same 
Consequences for the same anti-doping 
rule violations. These rules must be 
the same whether a hearing takes 
place before an International  
Federation, at the national level  
or before the Court of Arbitration  
for Sport. 

Code provisions not listed in Article 
23.2.2 are still mandatory in substance 
even though an Anti-Doping  
Organization is not required to  
incorporate them verbatim. Those 
provisions generally fall into two  
categories. First, some provisions  
direct Anti-Doping Organizations 
to take certain actions but there is 
no need to restate the provision in 

the Anti-Doping Organization’s own 
anti-doping rules. For example, each 
Anti-Doping Organization must plan 
and conduct Testing as required by 
Article 5, but these directives to the 
Anti-Doping Organization need not  
be repeated in the Anti-Doping  
Organization’s own rules. Second, 
some provisions are mandatory in 
substance but give each Anti-Doping 
Organization some flexibility in the 
implementation of the principles stated 
in the provision. As an example,  
it is not necessary for effective  
harmonization to force all Signatories 
to use one single results management 
and hearing process. At present,  
there are many different, yet equally 
effective processes for results  
management and hearings within 
different International Federations and 
different national bodies. The Code 
does not require absolute uniformity 
in results management and hearing

World Anti-Doping Code • 2015ARTICLE 1  Definition of Doping
ARTICLE 2  Anti-Doping Rule Violations

ARTICLE 1  DEFINITION OF DOPING

Doping is defined as the occurrence of one or more of the  
anti-doping  rule  violations  set  forth  in  Article  2.1  through  
Article 2.10 of the Code.

ARTICLE 2  ANTI-DOPING RULE VIOLATIONS

The  purpose  of  Article  2  is  to  specify  the  circumstances  and 
conduct which constitute anti-doping rule violations. Hearings 
in doping cases will proceed based on the assertion that one or 
more of these specific rules have been violated.
athletes or other Persons shall be responsible for knowing what 
constitutes  an  anti-doping  rule  violation  and  the  substances 
and methods which have been included on the Prohibited list.
The following constitute anti-doping rule violations:

2.1 

 

 Presence of a Prohibited Substance or its  
Metabolites or Markers in an Athlete’s Sample
2.1.1 

 it  is  each  athlete’s  personal  duty  to  ensure 
that  no  Prohibited  Substance  enters  his  or 
her  body.  athletes  are  responsible  for  any 
Prohibited  Substance  or 
its  Metabolites  or 
Markers  found  to  be  present  in  their  Samples. 
Accordingly, it is not necessary that intent, fault, 
negligence  or  knowing  use  on  the  athlete’s 
part  be  demonstrated  in  order  to  establish  an  
anti-doping rule violation under Article 2.1.

[Comment to Article 2.1.1: An  
anti-doping rule violation is committed 
under this Article without regard to 
an Athlete’s Fault. This rule has been 
referred to in various CAS decisions as 
“Strict Liability”. An Athlete’s Fault is 

taken into consideration in determining 
the Consequences of this anti-doping 
rule violation under Article 10. This 
principle has consistently been upheld 
by CAS.]

2.1.3 

2.1.4 

 Sufficient  proof  of  an  anti-doping  rule  violation 
under  Article  2.1  is  established  by  any  of  the 
following:  presence  of  a  Prohibited  Substance 
or  its  Metabolites  or  Markers  in  the  athlete’s  A 
Sample where the athlete waives analysis of the 
B Sample and the B Sample is not analyzed; or, 
where  the  athlete’s  B  Sample  is  analyzed  and 
the  analysis  of  the  athlete’s  B  Sample  confirms 
the  presence  of  the  Prohibited  Substance  or  its 
Metabolites  or  Markers  found  in  the  athlete’s  A 
Sample; or, where the athlete’s B Sample is split 
into  two  bottles  and  the  analysis  of  the  second 
bottle  confirms  the  presence  of  the  Prohibited 
Substance or its Metabolites or Markers found in 
the first bottle.
 Excepting 
for  which  a 
quantitative threshold is specifically identified in 
the Prohibited list, the presence of any quantity 
of  a  Prohibited  Substance  or  its  Metabolites  or 
Markers  in  an  athlete’s  Sample  shall  constitute 
an anti-doping rule violation.
 As an exception to the general rule of Article 2.1, 
the Prohibited list or International Standards may 
establish  special  criteria  for  the  evaluation  of 
Prohibited Substances that can also be produced 
endogenously.

[Comment to Article 2.1.2: The  
Anti-Doping Organization with results 
management responsibility may,  
at its discretion, choose to have the  

B Sample analyzed even if the Athlete 
does not request the analysis of the  
B Sample.]

 Use or Attempted Use by an Athlete of a  
Prohibited Substance or a Prohibited Method

 

 

2.2.1 

2.2.2 

 it  is  each  athlete’s  personal  duty  to  ensure 
that  no  Prohibited  Substance  enters  his  or  her 
body  and  that  no  Prohibited  Method  is  used. 
Accordingly, it is not necessary that intent, fault, 
negligence  or  knowing  use  on  the  athlete’s 
part  be  demonstrated  in  order  to  establish  an  
anti-doping rule violation for use of a Prohibited 
Substance or a Prohibited Method.
 The  success  or  failure  of  the  use  or  attempted 
use  of  a  Prohibited  Substance  or  Prohibited 
Method  is  not  material.  it  is  sufficient  that  the 
Prohibited  Substance  or  Prohibited  Method  was 
used or attempted to be used for an anti-doping 
rule violation to be committed.

[Comment to Article 2.2: It has always 
been the case that Use or Attempted 
Use of a Prohibited Substance or 
Prohibited Method may be established 
by any reliable means. As noted in 
the Comment to Article 3.2, unlike 
the proof required to establish an 
anti-doping rule violation under 
Article 2.1, Use or Attempted Use 
may also be established by other 
reliable means such as admissions 
by the Athlete, witness statements, 
documentary evidence, conclusions 
drawn from longitudinal profiling, 
including data collected as part of the 
Athlete Biological Passport, or other 

analytical information which does not 
otherwise satisfy all the requirements 
to establish “Presence” of a Prohibited 
Substance under Article 2.1.

For example, Use may be established 
based upon reliable analytical data 
from the analysis of an A Sample 
(without confirmation from an analysis 
of a B Sample) or from the analysis of a 
B Sample alone where the Anti-Doping 
Organization provides a satisfactory 
explanation for the lack of confirmation 
in the other Sample.]

[Comment to Article 2.2.2:  
Demonstrating the “Attempted Use” of 
a Prohibited Substance or a Prohibited 
Method requires proof of intent on the 
Athlete’s part. The fact that intent may 
be required to prove this particular 
anti-doping rule violation does not 
undermine the Strict Liability principle 
established for violations of Article 2.1 
and violations of Article 2.2 in respect 
of Use of a Prohibited Substance or 
Prohibited Method.

An Athlete’s Use of a Prohibited  
Substance constitutes an anti-doping 
rule violation unless such substance 
is not prohibited Out-of-Competition 
and the Athlete’s Use takes place 
Out-of-Competition. (However, the 
presence of a Prohibited Substance or 
its Metabolites or Markers in a Sample 
collected In-Competition is a violation 
of Article 2.1 regardless of when  
that substance might have been 
administered.)]

ARTICLE 2  Anti-Doping Rule Violations
ARTICLE 3  Proof of Doping

 in order for this provision to apply, it is necessary 
that  the  athlete  or  other  Person  has  previously 
been  advised 
in  writing  by  an  anti-doping 
organization with jurisdiction over the athlete or 
other Person, or by Wada, of the athlete Support 
Person’s  disqualifying  status  and  the  potential 
Consequence of prohibited association and that 
the athlete or other Person can reasonably avoid 
the  association.  The  anti-doping  organization 
shall  also  use  reasonable  efforts  to  advise  the 
athlete Support Person who is the subject of the 
notice  to  the  athlete  or  other  Person  that  the 
athlete Support Person may, within 15 days, come 
forward to the anti-doping organization to explain 
that the criteria described in Articles 2.10.1 and 
2.10.2 do not apply to him or her. (Notwithstanding 
Article  17,  this  Article  applies  even  when  the 
athlete  Support  Person’s  disqualifying  conduct 
occurred  prior  to  the  effective  date  provided  in 
Article 25.)
 The  burden  shall  be  on  the  athlete  or  other 
Person  to  establish  that  any  association  with 
athlete  Support  Personnel  described  in  Article 
2.10.1 or 2.10.2 is not in a professional or sport-
related capacity. 
 anti-doping  organizations  that  are  aware  of 
athlete Support Personnel who meet the criteria 
described in Article 2.10.1, 2.10.2, or 2.10.3 shall 
submit that information to Wada.

[Comment to Article 2.10: Athletes 
and other Persons must not work with 
coaches, trainers, physicians or other 
Athlete Support Personnel who are 
Ineligible on account of an anti- 
doping rule violation or who have been 
criminally convicted or professionally 
disciplined in relation to doping. Some 
examples of the types of association 

which are prohibited include: obtaining 
training, strategy, technique, nutrition 
or medical advice; obtaining therapy, 
treatment or prescriptions; providing 
any bodily products for analysis; or 
allowing the Athlete Support Person 
to serve as an agent or representative. 
Prohibited association need not involve 
any form of compensation.]

3.1  Burdens and Standards of Proof
 

 The  anti-doping  organization  shall  have  the  burden 
of  establishing  that  an  anti-doping  rule  violation  has 
occurred.  The  standard  of  proof  shall  be  whether  the 
anti-doping organization has established an anti-doping 
rule  violation  to  the  comfortable  satisfaction  of  the 
hearing  panel,  bearing  in  mind  the  seriousness  of  the 
allegation  which  is  made.  This  standard  of  proof  in  all 
cases is greater than a mere balance of probability but 
less  than  proof  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  Where  the 
Code places the burden of proof upon the athlete or other 
Person  alleged  to  have  committed  an  anti-doping  rule 
violation  to  rebut  a  presumption  or  establish  specified 
facts or circumstances, the standard of proof shall be by 
a balance of probability.

3.2  Methods of Establishing Facts and Presumptions 
 

 Facts  related  to  anti-doping  rule  violations  may  be 
established by any reliable means, including admissions. 
The following rules of proof shall be applicable in doping 
cases:

 Analytical  methods  or  decision  limits  approved 
by  Wada  after  consultation  within  the  relevant 
scientific  community  and  which  have  been 

 

[Comment to Article 3.1: This standard 
of proof required to be met by the Anti-
Doping Organization is comparable 

to the standard which is applied in 
most countries to cases involving 
professional misconduct.]

[Comment to Article 3.2: For example, 
an Anti-Doping Organization may 
establish an anti-doping rule violation 
under Article 2.2 based on the Athlete’s 
admissions, the credible testimony of 
third Persons, reliable documentary 
evidence, reliable analytical data from 
either an A or B Sample as provided 

in the Comments to Article 2.2, or 
conclusions drawn from the profile of 
a series of the Athlete’s blood or urine

seeking  to  rebut  this  presumption  of  scientific 
validity  shall,  as  a  condition  precedent  to 
any  such  challenge,  first  notify  Wada  of  the 
challenge  and  the  basis  of  the  challenge.  CaS, 
on  its  own  initiative,  may  also  inform  Wada  of 
any such challenge. At Wada’s request, the CaS

expert to assist the panel in its evaluation of the 
challenge.  Within  10  days  of  Wada’s  receipt  of 
such notice, and Wada’s receipt of the CaS file, 
Wada shall also have the right to intervene as a 
party, appear amicus curiae or otherwise provide 
evidence in such proceeding.

laboratories approved by Wada, are presumed 
to have conducted Sample analysis and custodial 
procedures in accordance with the international 
Standard

other  Person  may  rebut  this  presumption 
by  establishing  that  a  departure  from  the 
international Standard for Laboratories occurred 
which could reasonably have caused the adverse 
analytical finding.

presumption by showing that a departure from

or policy which could reasonably have caused an 
anti-doping  rule  violation  based  on  an  adverse 
analytical  finding  or  other  anti-doping  rule 
violation, then the anti-doping organization shall 
have the burden to establish that such departure 
did not cause the adverse analytical finding or the 
factual basis for the anti-doping rule violation.
 The facts established by a decision of a court or 
professional  disciplinary  tribunal  of  competent 
jurisdiction which is not the subject of a pending 
appeal shall be irrebuttable evidence against the 
athlete  or  other  Person  to  whom  the  decision 
pertained  of  those  facts  unless  the  athlete 
or  other  Person  establishes  that  the  decision 
violated principles of natural justice.
 The hearing panel in a hearing on an anti-doping 
rule violation may draw an inference adverse to 
the  athlete  or  other  Person  who  is  asserted  to 
have  committed  an  anti-doping  rule  violation 
based on the athlete’s or other Person’s refusal, 
after  a  request  made  in  a  reasonable  time  in 
advance of the hearing, to appear at the hearing 
(either in person or telephonically as directed by 
the hearing panel) and to answer questions from

Specified Substances identified in 
Article 4.2.2 should not in any way be 
considered less important or less

 Medical  or  other  scientific  evidence, 
pharmacological  effect  or  experience 
that the substance or method, alone or 
in combination with other substances or 
methods, has the potential to enhance 
or enhances sport performance; 
 Medical  or  other  scientific  evidence, 
pharmacological  effect  or  experience 
that the use of the substance or method 
represents an actual or potential health 
risk to the athlete;

ARTICLE 4  The Prohibited List

 The  Major  event  organization  must 
ensure  a  process  is  available  for  an 
athlete  to  apply  for  a  tue  if  he  or  she 
does not already have one. if the tue is 
granted, it is effective for its event only. 
 Where  the  athlete  already  has  a  tue 
granted  by  his  or  her  national  anti-
doping  organization  or 
international 
Federation, if that tue meets the criteria 
set out in the international Standard for 
Therapeutic Use Exemptions, the Major 
event organization must recognize it. If 
the Major event organization decides the 
tue does not meet those criteria and so 
refuses to recognize it, it must notify the 
athlete promptly, explaining its reasons. 
 A decision by a Major event organization 
not  to  recognize  or  not  to  grant  a 
tue  may  be  appealed  by  the  athlete 
exclusively  to  an 
independent  body 
established  or  appointed  by  the  Major 
event organization for that purpose. if the 
athlete does not appeal (or the appeal is 
unsuccessful),  he  or  she  may  not  use 
the  substance  or  method  in  question 
in  connection  with  the  event,  but  any 
tue  granted  by  his  or  her  national  
anti-doping organization or international 
Federation for that substance or method 
remains valid outside of that event.

[Comment to Article 4.4.4.3: For  
example, the CAS Ad Hoc Division or  
a similar body may act as the  
independent appeal body for particular 
Events, or WADA may agree to perform 
that function. If neither CAS nor WADA 

are performing that function, WADA 
retains the right (but not the obligation) 
to review the TUE decisions made in 
connection with the Event at any time, 
in accordance with Article 4.4.6.]

 if an anti-doping organization chooses to collect a 
Sample from a Person who is not an International-
level or national-level athlete, and that Person 
is  using  a  Prohibited  Substance  or  Prohibited 
Method for therapeutic reasons, the anti-doping 
organization may permit him or her to apply for a 
retroactive tue.
 Wada must review an international Federation’s 
decision not to recognize a tue granted by the 
national anti-doping organization that is referred 
to  it  by  the  athlete  or  the  athlete’s  national  
anti-doping organization. in addition, Wada must 
review an international Federation’s decision to 
grant a tue that is referred to it by the athlete’s 
national  anti-doping  organization.  Wada  may 
review  any  other  tue  decisions  at  any  time, 
whether upon request by those affected or on its 
own initiative. if the tue decision being reviewed 
meets  the  criteria  set  out  in  the  international 
Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions, Wada 
will not interfere with it. if the tue decision does 
not meet those criteria, Wada will reverse it. 
 Any tue decision by an international Federation 
(or by a national anti-doping organization where 
it  has  agreed  to  consider  the  application  on 
behalf of an international Federation) that is not 
reviewed by Wada, or that is reviewed by Wada 
but is not reversed upon review, may be appealed 
by  the  athlete  and/or  the  athlete’s  national  
anti-doping organization, exclusively to CaS.

be entitled to charge a fee to cover the 
costs of (a) any review it is required 
to conduct in accordance with Article 

4.4.6; and (b) any review it chooses 
to conduct, where the decision being 
reviewed is reversed.] 

[Comment to Article 4.4.7: In such  
cases, the decision being appealed 
is the International Federation’s TUE 
decision, not WADA’s decision not to 
review the TUE decision or (having 
reviewed it) not to reverse the TUE  
decision. However, the time to 

appeal the TUE decision does not 
begin to run until the date that WADA 
communicates its decision. In any 
event, whether the decision has been 
reviewed by WADA or not, WADA shall 
be given notice of the appeal so that it 
may participate if it sees fit.]

 A failure to take action within a reasonable time

 Monitoring Program
 Wada, in consultation with Signatories and governments, 
shall  establish  a  monitoring  program  regarding

which Wada wishes to monitor in order to detect patterns 
of  misuse  in  sport.  Wada  shall  publish,  in  advance  of 
any  testing,  the  substances  that  will  be  monitored. 
Laboratories  will  report  the  instances  of  reported  use 
or  detected  presence  of  these  substances  to  Wada 
periodically on an aggregate basis by sport and whether 
the  Samples  were  collected  In-Competition  or  out–of-

information  regarding  specific  Samples.  Wada  shall 
make available to international Federations and national

aggregate statistical information by sport regarding the 
additional substances. Wada shall implement measures 
to ensure that strict anonymity of individual athletes is

use or detected presence of a monitored substance shall 
not constitute an anti-doping rule violation.

 Except  as  otherwise  provided  below,  only  a 
single  organization  should  be  responsible  for 
initiating  and  directing  testing  at  event  venues 
during  an  event  Period.  At  International  events, 
the  collection  of  Samples  shall  be  initiated 
and  directed  by  the  international  organization 
which is the ruling body for the event (e.g., the 
international Olympic Committee for the Olympic 
games, the international Federation for a World 
Championship,  and  the  Pan-American  Sports 
Organization  for  the  Pan  American  Games).  At 
national events, the collection of Samples shall be 
initiated and directed by the national anti-doping 
organization of that country. At the request of the 
ruling body for an event, any testing during the 
event Period outside of the event venues shall be 
coordinated with that ruling body.
 if  an  anti-doping  organization  which  would 
otherwise  have  testing  authority  but  is  not 
responsible  for  initiating  and  directing  testing 
at an event desires to conduct testing of athletes 
at the event venues during the event Period, the 
anti-doping  organization  shall  first  confer  with 
the ruling body of the event to obtain permission 
to  conduct  and  coordinate  such  testing.  if  the 
anti-doping organization is not satisfied with the 
response from the ruling body of the event, the 
anti-doping organization may, in accordance with 
procedures  published  by  Wada,  ask  Wada  for 
permission to conduct testing and to determine 
how to coordinate such testing. Wada shall not 
grant approval for such testing before consulting 
with and informing the ruling body for the event. 

[Comment to Article 5.3.1: Some ruling 
bodies for International Events may

 For  purposes  of  Article  2.1,  Samples  shall  be  analyzed 
only  in  Wada-accredited  laboratories  or  laboratories 
otherwise approved by Wada. The choice of the Wada-
accredited  or  Wada-approved  laboratory  used  for  the 
Sample  analysis  shall  be  determined  exclusively  by 
the  anti-doping  organization  responsible  for  results 
management.

[Comment to Article 6.1: For cost and 
geographic access reasons, WADA may 
approve laboratories which are not  
WADA-accredited to perform particular 
analyses, for example, analysis of 
blood which should be delivered from 
the collection site to the laboratory 
within a set deadline. Before approving 
any such laboratory, WADA will 
ensure it meets the high analytical and 
custodial standards required by WADA.

Violations of Article 2.1 may be 
established only by Sample analysis 
performed by a WADA-accredited 
laboratory or another laboratory 
approved by WADA. Violations of 
other Articles may be established 
using analytical results from other 
laboratories so long as the results  
are reliable.]

and Prohibited Methods identified on the Prohibited list and 
other substances as may be directed by Wada pursuant 
to Article 4.5, or to assist an anti-doping organization in 
profiling relevant parameters in an athlete’s urine, blood 
or other matrix, including DNA or genomic profiling, or 
for  any  other  legitimate  anti-doping  purpose.  Samples 
may be collected and stored for future analysis. 

6.3  Research on Samples 
 

 No Sample may be used for research without the athlete’s 
written consent. Samples used for purposes other than 
Article 6.2 shall have any means of identification removed 
such  that  they  cannot  be  traced  back  to  a  particular 
athlete.

6.4 
 

Standards for Sample Analysis and Reporting
 Laboratories  shall  analyze  Samples  and  report  results 
in  conformity  with  the 
international  Standard  for 
Laboratories. To ensure effective testing, the Technical 
Document referenced at Article 5.4.1 will establish risk 
assessment-based Sample analysis menus appropriate 
for  particular  sports  and  sport  disciplines,  and 
laboratories  shall  analyze  Samples  in  conformity  with 
those menus, except as follows:

 

6.4.1 

 anti-doping  organizations  may  request  that 
laboratories  analyze  their  Samples  using  more 
extensive  menus  than  those  described  in  the 
Technical Document. 

[Comment to Article 6.2: For example, 
relevant profile information could 
be used to direct Target Testing or to 

support an anti-doping rule violation 
proceeding under Article 2.2, or both.]

[Comment to Article 6.3: As is the 
case in most medical contexts, use 
of anonymized Samples for quality 

assurance, quality improvement, or to 
establish reference populations is not 
considered research.]

World Anti-Doping Code • 20151   PARTDoping Control 

 

6.4.2 

6.4.3 

 anti-doping  organizations  may  request  that 
laboratories  analyze 
their  Samples  using 
less  extensive  menus  than  those  described 
in  the  Technical  Document  only  if  they  have 
satisfied  Wada  that,  because  of  the  particular 
circumstances of their country or sport, as set 
out in their test distribution plan, less extensive 
analysis would be appropriate.
 As  provided  in  the  international  Standard  for 
Laboratories, laboratories at their own initiative 
and expense may analyze Samples for Prohibited 
Substances  or  Prohibited  Methods  not  included 
on  the  Sample  analysis  menu  described  in  the 
Technical Document or specified by the testing 
authority.  Results  from  any  such  analysis  shall 
be  reported  and  have  the  same  validity  and 
Consequence as any other analytical result.

6.5 
 

Further Analysis of Samples
 Any  Sample  may  be  subject  to  further  analysis  by 
the  anti-doping  organization  responsible  for  results 
management at any time before both the A and B Sample 
analytical  results  (or  A  Sample  result  where  B  Sample 
analysis has been waived or will not be performed) have 
been  communicated  by  the  anti-doping  organization 
to  the  athlete  as  the  asserted  basis  for  an  Article  2.1  
anti-doping rule violation.

[Comment to Article 6.4: The objective 
of this Article is to extend the principle 
of “Intelligent Testing” to the Sample 
analysis menu so as to most effectively 
and efficiently detect doping. It is 
recognized that the resources available 

to fight doping are limited and that 
increasing the Sample analysis menu 
may, in some sports and countries, 
reduce the number of Samples which 
can be analyzed.]

45

World Anti-Doping Code • 2015ARTICLE 6  Analysis of Samples
ARTICLE 7  Results Management

 

 Samples may be stored and subjected to further analyses 
for the purpose of Article 6.2 at any time exclusively at the 
direction of the anti-doping organization that initiated and 
directed Sample collection or Wada. (Any Sample storage 
or further analysis initiated by Wada shall be at Wada’s 
expense.)  Further  analysis  of  Samples  shall  conform 
with the requirements of the international Standard for 
Laboratories and the international Standard for Testing 
and investigations.

ARTICLE 7  RESULTS MANAGEMENT

Each anti-doping organization conducting results management 
shall establish a process for the pre-hearing administration of 
potential anti-doping rule violations that respects the following 
principles:

[Comment to Article 7: Various 
Signatories have created their own 
approaches to results management. 
While the various approaches have 
not been entirely uniform, many 
have proven to be fair and effective 
systems for results management. 
The Code does not supplant each of 
the Signatories’ results management 
systems. This Article does, however, 
specify basic principles in order to 
ensure the fundamental fairness of the 
results management process which 
must be observed by each Signatory. 
The specific anti-doping rules of 
each Signatory shall be consistent 

with these basic principles. Not all 
anti-doping proceedings which have 
been initiated by an Anti-Doping 
Organization need to go to hearing. 
There may be cases where the Athlete 
or other Person agrees to the sanction 
which is either mandated by the Code 
or which the Anti-Doping Organization 
considers appropriate where flexibility 
in sanctioning is permitted. In all 
cases, a sanction imposed on the basis 
of such an agreement will be reported 
to parties with a right to appeal under 
Article 13.2.3 as provided in Article 
14.2.2 and published as provided in 
Article 14.3.2.]

46

World Anti-Doping Code • 20151   PARTDoping Control7.1  Responsibility for Conducting Results Management
 

 Except as provided in Articles 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 below, results 
management  and  hearings  shall  be  the  responsibility 
of,  and  shall  be  governed  by,  the  procedural  rules  of 
the  anti-doping  organization  that  initiated  and  directed 
Sample collection (or, if no Sample collection is involved, 
the anti-doping organization which first provides notice to 
an athlete or other Person of an asserted anti-doping rule 
violation and then diligently pursues that anti-doping rule 
violation).  Regardless  of  which  organization  conducts 
results  management  or  hearings,  the  principles  set 
forth in this Article and Article 8 shall be respected and 
the  rules  identified  in  Article  23.2.2  to  be  incorporated 
without substantive change must be followed.
 if a dispute arises between anti-doping organizations over 
which anti-doping organization has results management 
responsibility, Wada shall decide which organization has 
such  responsibility.  Wada’s  decision  may  be  appealed 
to  CaS  within  seven  days  of  notification  of  the  Wada 
decision by any of the anti-doping organizations involved 
in the dispute. The appeal shall be dealt with by CaS in 
an expedited manner and shall be heard before a single 
arbitrator.
 Where  a  national  anti-doping  organization  elects  to 
collect  additional  Samples  pursuant  to  Article  5.2.6, 
then it shall be considered the anti-doping organization 
that  initiated  and  directed  Sample  collection.  However, 
where the national anti-doping organization only directs 
the laboratory to perform additional types of analysis at 
the national anti-doping organization’s expense, then the 
international Federation or Major event organization shall 
be considered the anti-doping organization that initiated 
and directed Sample collection. 

 

 

[Comment to Article 7.1: In some 
cases, the procedural rules of the  
Anti-Doping Organization which 
initiated and directed the Sample 
collection may specify that results 
management will be handled by 

another organization (e.g., the 
Athlete’s National Federation). In 
such event, it shall be the Anti-Doping 
Organization’s responsibility to confirm 
that the other organization’s rules are 
consistent with the Code.]

ARTICLE 7  Results Management

 in circumstances where the rules of a national 
anti-doping organization do not give the national 
anti-doping organization authority over an athlete 
or other Person who is not a national, resident, 
license holder, or member of a sport organization 
of  that  country,  or  the  national  anti-doping 
organization declines to exercise such authority, 
results management shall be conducted by the 
applicable international Federation or by a third 
party as directed by the rules of the international 
Federation.  Results  management  and 
the 
conduct  of  hearings  for  a  test  conducted  by 
Wada on its own initiative, or an anti-doping rule 
violation discovered by Wada, will be conducted 
by  the  anti-doping  organization  designated  by 
Wada. Results management and the conduct of 
hearings for a test conducted by the international 
Olympic Committee, the international Paralympic 
Committee, or another Major event organization, 
or an anti-doping rule violation discovered by one 
of those organizations, shall be referred to the 
applicable international Federation in relation to 
Consequences beyond exclusion from the event, 
disqualification  of  event  results,  forfeiture  of 
any medals, points, or prizes from the event, or 
recovery  of  costs  applicable  to  the  anti-doping 
rule violation. 

[Comment to Article 7.1.1: The  
Athlete’s or other Person’s  
International Federation has been 
made the Anti-Doping Organization of 
last resort for results management to 
avoid the possibility that no Anti- 
Doping Organization would have 

authority to conduct results  
management. An International 
Federation is free to provide in its own 
anti-doping rules that the Athlete’s or 
other Person’s National Anti-Doping 
Organization shall conduct results 
management.]

international  Federation  or 
the  national  
anti-doping  organization  with  whom  the  athlete 
in  question  files  his  or  her  whereabouts 
information,  as  provided  in  the  international

 Upon  receipt  of  an  adverse  analytical  finding,  the  
anti-doping  organization  responsible 
for  results 
management  shall  conduct  a  review  to  determine 
whether: (a) an applicable tue has been granted or will 
be  granted  as  provided  in  the  international  Standard 
for  Therapeutic  Use  Exemptions,  or  (b)  there  is  any 
apparent departure from the international Standard for

to  a  tue  as  provided  in  the  international  Standard  for 
Therapeutic Use Exemptions, or departure that caused 
the adverse analytical finding, the anti-doping organization 
shall promptly notify the athlete, in the manner set out 
in  Articles  14.1.1  and  14.1.3  and  its  own  rules,  of:  (a) 
the  adverse  analytical  finding;  (b)  the  anti-doping  rule 
violated; and (c) the athlete’s right to promptly request 
the analysis of the B Sample or, failing such request, that 
the  B  Sample  analysis  may  be  deemed  waived;  (d)  the

if  the  athlete  or  anti-doping  organization  chooses  to 
request an analysis of the B Sample; (e) the opportunity 
for  the  athlete  and/or  the  athlete’s  representative  to 
attend  the  B  Sample  opening  and  analysis  within  the

includes 
information  as  required  by  the  international  Standard 
for Laboratories. if the anti-doping organization decides 
not to bring forward the adverse analytical finding as an  
anti-doping  rule  violation,  it  shall  so  notify  the  athlete 
and  the  anti-doping  organizations  as  described  in  
Article 14.1.2. 
 in  all  cases  where  an  athlete  has  been  notified  of  an  
anti-doping  rule  violation  that  does  not  result  in  a

 As provided in the international Standard for Laboratories, 
in  some  circumstances  laboratories  are  directed  to 
report the presence of Prohibited Substances, which may 
also  be  produced  endogenously,  as  atypical  findings 
subject  to  further  investigation.  Upon  receipt  of  an 
atypical finding, the anti-doping organization responsible 
for  results  management  shall  conduct  a  review  to 
determine  whether:  (a)  an  applicable  tue  has  been 
granted or will be granted as provided in the international 
Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions, or (b) there is 
any apparent departure from the international Standard 
for Testing and investigations or international Standard 
for Laboratories that caused the atypical finding. if that 
review  does  not  reveal  an  applicable  tue  or  departure 
that  caused  the  atypical  finding,  the  anti-doping 
organization  shall  conduct  the  required  investigation. 
After  the  investigation  is  completed,  the  athlete  and 
other anti-doping organizations identified in Article 14.1.2 
shall be notified whether or not the atypical finding will 
be brought forward as an adverse analytical finding. The 
athlete shall be notified as provided in Article 7.3. 
7.4.1 

 The  anti-doping  organization  will  not  provide 
notice of an atypical finding until it has completed 
its  investigation  and  decided  whether  it  will 
bring the atypical finding forward as an adverse 
analytical  finding  unless  one  of  the  following 
circumstances exists:
 (a)  if  the  anti-doping  organization  determines 
the  B  Sample  should  be  analyzed  prior  to  the 
conclusion of its investigation under Article 7.4, 

 

 

 

[Comment to Article 7.4: The “required 
investigation” described in this Article 
will depend on the situation. For  
example, if it has previously  
determined that an Athlete  

has a naturally elevated  
testosterone/epitestosterone ratio, 
confirmation that an Atypical Finding 
is consistent with that prior ratio is a 
sufficient investigation.]

any prior anti-doping rule violation exists.

Principles Applicable to Provisional Suspensions
7.9.1 

 Mandatory  Provisional  Suspension  after  an 
adverse analytical finding.
 The  Signatories  listed  below  shall  adopt  rules 
providing  that  when  an  adverse  analytical 
finding  is  received  for  a  Prohibited  Substance 
or  a  Prohibited  Method,  other  than  a  Specified 
Substance,  a  Provisional  Suspension  shall 
be  imposed  promptly  after  the  review  and 
notification  described  in  Article  7.2,  7.3  or  7.5:  
where the Signatory is the ruling body of an event 
(for application to that event); where the Signatory 
is responsible for team selection (for application 
to  that  team  selection);  where  the  Signatory 
is  the  applicable  international  Federation;  or 
where  the  Signatory  is  another  anti-doping 
organization  which  has  results  management 
authority  over  the  alleged  anti-doping  rule 
violation.  A  mandatory  Provisional  Suspension 
may  be  eliminated  if  the  athlete  demonstrates 
to the hearing panel that the violation is likely to 
have involved a Contaminated Product. A hearing 
body’s  decision  not  to  eliminate  a  mandatory 
Provisional Suspension on account of the athlete’s 
assertion regarding a Contaminated Product shall 
not be appealable. 
 Provided, however, that a Provisional Suspension 
may not be imposed unless the athlete is given 
either:  (a)  an  opportunity  for  a  Provisional 
hearing,  either  before 
the 

imposition  of

imposition  of  the  Provisional  Suspension;  or 
(b)  an  opportunity  for  an  expedited  hearing  in

imposition of a Provisional Suspension.
 Optional  Provisional  Suspension  based  on 
an  adverse  analytical  finding 
for  Specified 
Substances,  Contaminated  Products,  or  other 
Anti-Doping Rule Violations.
 A  Signatory  may  adopt  rules,  applicable  to  any 
event for which the Signatory is the ruling body 
or to any team selection process for which the 
Signatory  is  responsible  or  where  the  Signatory 
is the applicable international Federation or has 
results management authority over the alleged 
anti-doping rule violation, permitting Provisional 
Suspensions to be imposed for anti-doping rule 
violations  not  covered  by  Article  7.9.1  prior  to 
analysis of the athlete’s B Sample or final hearing 
as described in Article 8. 
 Provided, however, that a Provisional Suspension 
may not be imposed unless the athlete or other 
Person  is  given  either:  (a)  an  opportunity  for  a 
Provisional  hearing,  either  before  imposition  of 
the  Provisional  Suspension  or  on  a  timely  basis 
after  imposition  of  the  Provisional  Suspension; 
or (b) an opportunity for an expedited hearing in 
accordance with Article 8 on a timely basis after 
imposition of a Provisional Suspension.
 if a Provisional Suspension is imposed based on 
an  A  Sample  adverse  analytical  finding  and  a 
subsequent  B  Sample  analysis  (if  requested  by 
the athlete or anti-doping organization) does not 
confirm the A Sample analysis, then the athlete 
shall  not  be  subject  to  any  further  Provisional 
Suspension  on  account  of  a  violation  of  Article 
2.1. in circumstances where the athlete (or the

not  confirm  the  A  Sample  finding,  if,  without 
otherwise  affecting  the  Competition,  it  is  still 
possible for the athlete or team to be reinserted, 
the athlete or team may continue to take part in 
the Competition.

7.10  Notification of Results Management Decisions
 

 in  all  cases  where  an  anti-doping  organization  has 
asserted  the  commission  of  an  anti-doping  rule 
violation, withdrawn the assertion of an anti-doping rule 
violation,  imposed  a  Provisional  Suspension,  or  agreed 
with  an  athlete  or  other  Person  to  the  imposition  of  a 
sanction without a hearing, that anti-doping organization 
shall give notice thereof as set forth in Article 14.2.1 to 
other  anti-doping  organizations  with  a  right  to  appeal 
under Article 13.2.3.

[Comment to Article 7.9: Before a  
Provisional Suspension can be  
unilaterally imposed by an Anti-Doping 
Organization, the internal review  
specified in the Code must first be 
completed. In addition, the Signatory 
imposing a Provisional Suspension 
shall ensure that the Athlete is given 
an opportunity for a Provisional 
Hearing either before or promptly 
after the imposition of the Provisional 
Suspension, or an expedited final 
hearing under Article 8 promptly after 
imposition of the Provisional  
Suspension. The Athlete has a right to 
appeal under Article 13.2.3. 

In the rare circumstance where the B 
Sample analysis does not confirm the 

A Sample finding, the Athlete who had 
been Provisionally Suspended will be 
allowed, where circumstances permit, 
to participate in subsequent  
Competitions during the Event. 
Similarly, depending upon the relevant 
rules of the International Federation 
in a Team Sport, if the team is still in 
Competition, the Athlete may be able 
to take part in future Competitions.

Athletes and other Persons shall 
receive credit for a Provisional  
Suspension against any period of  
Ineligibility which is ultimately 
imposed or accepted as provided in

anti-doping rule violation, each anti-doping organization 
with responsibility for results management shall provide, 
at a minimum, a fair hearing within a reasonable time 
by a fair and impartial hearing panel. A timely reasoned 
decision  specifically  including  an  explanation  of  the 
reason(s)  for  any  period  of  Ineligibility  shall  be  Publicly 
disclosed as provided in Article 14.3. 

[Comment to Article 7.11: Conduct by 
an Athlete or other Person before the 
Athlete or other Person was subject 
to the jurisdiction of any Anti-Doping 
Organization would not constitute an 

anti-doping rule violation but could 
be a legitimate basis for denying the 
Athlete or other Person membership in 
a sports organization.] 

[Comment to Article 8.1: This Article 
requires that at some point in the 
results management process, the 
Athlete or other Person shall be 
provided the opportunity for a timely, 
fair and impartial hearing. These 
principles are also found in Article 6.1 
of the Convention for the Protection 
of Human Rights and Fundamental 

Freedoms and are principles generally 
accepted in international law. This 
Article is not intended to supplant 
each Anti-Doping Organization’s own 
rules for hearings but rather to ensure 
that each Anti-Doping Organization 
provides a hearing process consistent 
with these principles.]

provided in the anti-doping organization’s rules. 

8.4  Notice of Decisions
 

 The reasoned hearing decision, or in cases where the 
hearing has been waived, a reasoned decision explaining 
the  action  taken,  shall  be  provided  by  the  anti-doping 
organization with results management responsibility to 
the athlete and to other anti-doping organizations with 
a  right  to  appeal  under  Article  13.2.3  as  provided  in 
Article 14.2.1.

[Comment to Article 8.2: For example, 
a hearing could be expedited on the 
eve of a major Event where the  
resolution of the anti-doping rule 
violation is necessary to determine 

the Athlete’s eligibility to participate 
in the Event or during an Event where 
the resolution of the case will affect 
the validity of the Athlete’s results or 
continued participation in the Event.]

Single Hearing Before CAS
 Anti-doping 
against 
International-level  athletes  or  national-level  athletes 
may,  with  the  consent  of  the  athlete,  the  anti-doping 
organization  with  results  management  responsibility, 
Wada,  and  any  other  anti-doping  organization  that 
would have had a right to appeal a first instance hearing 
decision  to  CaS,  be  heard  directly  at  CaS,  with  no 
requirement for a prior hearing.

ARTICLE 9   AUTOMATIC DISQUALIFICATION 

OF INDIVIDUAL RESULTS

An anti-doping rule violation in Individual Sports in connection 
with an In-Competition test automatically leads to disqualification 
of  the  result  obtained  in  that  Competition  with  all  resulting 
Consequences,  including  forfeiture  of  any  medals,  points  and 
prizes. 

[Comment to Article 8.5: In some 
cases, the combined cost of holding 
a hearing in the first instance at the 
international or national level, then 
rehearing the case de novo before CAS 
can be very substantial. Where all of 
the parties identified in this Article are 
satisfied that their interests will be 
adequately protected in a single  

hearing, there is no need for the  
Athlete or Anti-Doping Organizations  
to incur the extra expense of two  
hearings. An Anti-Doping Organization 
that wants to participate in the CAS 
hearing as a party or as an observer 
may condition its approval of a single 
hearing on being granted that right.]

[Comment to Article 9: For Team 
Sports, any awards received by 
individual players will be Disqualified. 
However, Disqualification of the team 
will be as provided in Article 11. In 
sports which are not Team Sports but 
where awards are given to teams, 

Disqualification or other disciplinary 
action against the team when one or 
more team members have committed 
an anti-doping rule violation shall be 
as provided in the applicable rules of 
the International Federation.]

 Disqualification of Results in the Event during which an 
Anti-Doping Rule Violation Occurs
 An  anti-doping  rule  violation  occurring  during  or  in 
connection with an event may, upon the decision of the 
ruling  body  of  the  event,  lead  to  disqualification  of  all 
of the athlete’s individual results obtained in that event 
with all Consequences, including forfeiture of all medals, 
points and prizes, except as provided in Article 10.1.1. 
 Factors  to  be  included  in  considering  whether  to 
disqualify  other  results  in  an  event  might  include,  for 
example,  the  seriousness  of  the  athlete’s  anti-doping 
rule violation and whether the athlete tested negative in 
the other Competitions. 
10.1.1 

 if the athlete establishes that he or she bears no 
fault or negligence for the violation, the athlete’s 
individual results in the other Competitions shall 
not  be  disqualified,  unless  the  athlete’s  results 
in  Competitions  other  than  the  Competition  in 
which  the  anti-doping  rule  violation  occurred 
were likely to have been affected by the athlete’s  
anti-doping rule violation.

 Ineligibility for Presence, Use or Attempted Use or 
Possession of a Prohibited Substance or

or suspension pursuant to Article 10.4, 10.5 or 10.6: 

[Comment to Article 10.1: Whereas 
Article 9 Disqualifies the result in a 
single Competition in which the Athlete 
tested positive (e.g., the 100 meter

races during the Event (e.g., the FINA

unless Article 10.5 or 10.6 are applicable:
10.3.1 

 For  violations  of  Article  2.3  or  Article  2.5,  the 
period of Ineligibility shall be four years unless, in 
the case of failing to submit to Sample collection, 
the athlete can establish that the commission of 
the anti-doping rule violation was not intentional 
(as defined in Article 10.2.3), in which case the 
period of Ineligibility shall be two years.
 For  violations  of  Article  2.4,  the  period  of 
Ineligibility shall be two years, subject to reduction 
down  to  a  minimum  of  one  year,  depending 
on  the  athlete’s  degree  of  fault.  The  flexibility 
between  two  years  and  one  year  of  Ineligibility 
in this Article is not available to athletes where 
a  pattern  of  last-minute  whereabouts  changes 
or other conduct raises a serious suspicion that 
the athlete was trying to avoid being available for 
testing.
 For  violations  of  Article  2.7  or  2.8,  the  period 
of Ineligibility shall be a minimum of four years 
up  to  lifetime  Ineligibility,  depending  on  the 
seriousness  of  the  violation.  An  Article  2.7  or 
Article  2.8  violation  involving  a  Minor  shall  be 
considered  a  particularly  serious  violation  and, 
if  committed  by  athlete  Support  Personnel  for 
violations  other  than  for  Specified  Substances, 
shall  result  in  lifetime  Ineligibility  for  athlete 
Support  Personnel. 
in  addition,  significant 
violations  of  Article  2.7  or  2.8  which  may  also 
violate non-sporting laws and regulations, shall

reporting Athlete Support Personnel to

not applicable to the determination 
of whether an anti-doping rule 
violation has occurred. They will only 
apply in exceptional circumstances, 
for example, where an Athlete 
could prove that, despite all due 
care, he or she was sabotaged by 
a competitor. Conversely, No Fault 
or Negligence would not apply in 
the following circumstances: (a) 
a positive test resulting from a 
mislabeled or contaminated vitamin 
or nutritional supplement (Athletes 
are responsible for what they ingest 
(Article 2.1.1) and have been warned 
against the possibility of supplement 
contamination); (b) the Administration 

of a Prohibited Substance by the 
Athlete’s personal physician or trainer 
without disclosure to the Athlete 
(Athletes are responsible for their 
choice of medical personnel and 
for advising medical personnel that 
they cannot be given any Prohibited 
Substance); and (c) sabotage of the 
Athlete’s food or drink by a spouse, 
coach or other Person within the 
Athlete’s circle of associates (Athletes 
are responsible for what they ingest 
and for the conduct of those Persons to 
whom they entrust access to their food

Athlete or other Person comes forward 
and admits to an anti-doping rule 
violation in circumstances where no 
Anti-Doping Organization is aware that 
an anti-doping rule violation might 
have been committed. It is not intended 
to apply to circumstances where the 

admission occurs after the Athlete 
or other Person believes he or she 
is about to be caught. The amount by 
which Ineligibility is reduced should be 
based on the likelihood that the Athlete 
or other Person would have been 
caught had he or she not come forward 
voluntarily.]

 An  athlete  or  other  Person  potentially  subject 
to  a  four-year  sanction  under  Article  10.2.1 
or  10.3.1 
(for  evading  or  refusing  Sample 
Collection or tampering with Sample Collection), 
by promptly admitting the asserted anti-doping 
rule  violation  after  being  confronted  by  an  
anti-doping  organization,  and  also  upon  the 
approval  and  at  the  discretion  of  both  Wada 
and  the  anti-doping  organization  with  results 
management  responsibility,  may  receive  a 
reduction  in  the  period  of  Ineligibility  down  to 
a  minimum  of  two  years,  depending  on  the 
seriousness  of  the  violation  and  the  athlete  or 
other Person’s degree of fault.
 Application of Multiple grounds for Reduction of 
a Sanction
 Where  an  athlete  or  other  Person  establishes 
entitlement to reduction in sanction under more 
than one provision of Article 10.4, 10.5 or 10.6, 
before  applying  any  reduction  or  suspension 
under  Article  10.6,  the  otherwise  applicable 
period  of  Ineligibility  shall  be  determined  in 
accordance  with  Articles  10.2,  10.3,  10.4,  and 
10.5.  if  the  athlete  or  other  Person  establishes 
entitlement  to  a  reduction  or  suspension  of 
the  period  of  Ineligibility  under  Article  10.6, 
then  the  period  of  Ineligibility  may  be  reduced 
or  suspended,  but  not  below  one-fourth  of  the 
otherwise applicable period of Ineligibility.

[Comment to Article 10.6.4: The 
appropriate sanction is determined 
in a sequence of four steps. First, the 
hearing panel determines which of 
the basic sanctions (Article 10.2, 10.3, 
10.4, or 10.5) apply to the particular 
anti-doping rule violation. Second, if 
the basic sanction provides for a range 
of sanctions, the hearing panel must 
determine the applicable sanction 
within that range according to the 

Athlete or other Person’s degree of 
Fault. In a third step, the hearing 
panel establishes whether there is a 
basis for elimination, suspension, or 
reduction of the sanction (Article 10.6). 
Finally, the hearing panel decides on 
the commencement of the period of 
Ineligibility under Article 10.11. 

Several examples of how Article 10 is 
to be applied are found in Appendix 2.]

 For  an  athlete  or  other  Person’s  second  anti-
doping  rule  violation,  the  period  of  Ineligibility 
shall be the greater of: 
 (a) six months;  
 (b) one-half of the period of Ineligibility imposed 
for  the  first  anti-doping  rule  violation  without 
taking into account any reduction under Article 
10.6; or 
 (c)  twice  the  period  of  Ineligibility  otherwise 
applicable  to  the  second  anti-doping  rule 
violation  treated  as  if  it  were  a  first  violation, 
without taking into account any reduction under 
Article 10.6. 

 The period of Ineligibility established above may then be 
further reduced by the application of Article 10.6. 
10.7.2 

 A  third  anti-doping  rule  violation  will  always 
result  in  a  lifetime  period  of  Ineligibility,  except 
if  the  third  violation  fulfills  the  condition  for 
elimination  or  reduction  of  the  period  of 
Ineligibility under Article 10.4 or 10.5, or involves 
a  violation  of  Article  2.4.  in  these  particular 
cases,  the  period  of  Ineligibility  shall  be  from 
eight years to lifetime Ineligibility.
 An  anti-doping  rule  violation  for  which  an 
athlete or other Person has established no fault 
or  negligence  shall  not  be  considered  a  prior 
violation for purposes of this Article. 
 Additional  Rules  for  Certain  Potential  Multiple 
Violations
10.7.4.1   For  purposes  of  imposing  sanctions 
under  Article  10.7,  an  anti-doping  rule 
violation will only be considered a second 
violation if the anti-doping organization

imposed.

 Where  there  have  been  substantial  delays  in 
the hearing process or other aspects of doping 
Control  not  attributable  to  the  athlete  or  other 
Person,  the  body  imposing  the  sanction  may 
start  the  period  of  Ineligibility  at  an  earlier

(which,  in  all  events,  for  an  athlete  means 
before  the  athlete  competes  again)  admits  the  
anti-doping rule violation after being confronted 
with  the  anti-doping  rule  violation  by  the

shall  be  disqualified  and  a  new  period  of 
Ineligibility equal in length to the original period

[Comment to Article 10: Harmonization 
of sanctions has been one of the most 
discussed and debated areas of anti-
doping. Harmonization means that the 
same rules and criteria are applied 
to assess the unique facts of each 
case. Arguments against requiring 
harmonization of sanctions are 
based on differences between sports 
including, for example, the following: 
in some sports the Athletes are 
professionals making a sizable income 
from the sport and in others the 
Athletes are true amateurs; in those 
sports where an Athlete’s career is 
short, a standard period of Ineligibility 
has a much more significant effect 
on the Athlete than in sports where 

careers are traditionally much longer. 
A primary argument in favor of 
harmonization is that it is simply not 
right that two Athletes from the same 
country who test positive for the same 
Prohibited Substance under similar 
circumstances should receive different 
sanctions only because they participate 
in different sports. In addition, 
flexibility in sanctioning has often been 
viewed as an unacceptable opportunity 
for some sporting organizations to 
be more lenient with dopers. The 
lack of harmonization of sanctions 
has also frequently been the source 
of jurisdictional conflicts between 
International Federations and National 
Anti-Doping Organizations.]

had  rendered  a  decision  finding  no  anti-doping  rule 
violation.  if  the  CaS  hearing  panel  determines  that  an 
anti-doping rule violation was committed and that Wada 
acted  reasonably  in  electing  to  appeal  directly  to  CaS, 
then Wada’s costs and attorney fees in prosecuting the 
appeal shall be reimbursed to Wada by the anti-doping 
organization.

[Comment to Article 13.2.4: This 
provision is necessary because since 
2011, CAS rules no longer permit an 
Athlete the right to cross appeal when 

an Anti-Doping Organization appeals 
a decision after the Athlete’s time for 
appeal has expired. This provision 
permits a full hearing for all parties.]

[Comment to Article 13.3: Given the 
different circumstances of each anti-
doping rule violation investigation and 
results management process, it is 
not feasible to establish a fixed time 
period for an Anti-Doping Organization 
to render a decision before WADA may 
intervene by appealing directly to CAS. 
Before taking such action, however, 
WADA will consult with the Anti-Doping 
Organization and give the Anti-Doping 

Organization an opportunity to explain 
why it has not yet rendered a decision. 
Nothing in this Article prohibits an 
International Federation from also 
having rules which authorize it to  
assume jurisdiction for matters 
in which the results management 
performed by one of its National 
Federations has been inappropriately 
delayed.]

ARTICLE 22   Involvement of Governments

ARTICLE 22   INVOLVEMENT OF 

GOVERNMENTS

Each government’s commitment to the Code will be evidenced 
by  its  signing  the  Copenhagen  Declaration  on  Anti-Doping  in 
Sport of 3 March 2003, and by ratifying, accepting, approving or 
acceding to the uneSCo Convention. The following Articles set 
forth the expectations of the Signatories.

22.1 

 Each  government  will  take  all  actions  and  measures 
necessary to comply with the uneSCo Convention.

22.2 

22.3 

 Each government will put in place legislation, regulation, 
policies or administrative practices for cooperation and 
sharing  of  information  with  anti-doping  organizations 
and sharing of data among anti-doping organizations as 
provided in the Code.

 Each  government  will  encourage  cooperation  between 
all  of  its  public  services  or  agencies  and  anti-doping 
organizations  to  timely  share  information  with  anti-
doping organizations which would be useful in the fight 
against doping and where to do so would not otherwise 
be legally prohibited.

22.4 

 Each government will respect arbitration as the preferred 
means  of  resolving  doping-related  disputes,  subject  to 
human  and  fundamental  rights  and  applicable  national 
law.

22.5 

 Each  government  that  does  not  have  a  national  anti-
doping  organization  in  its  country  will  work  with  its 
national olympic Committee to establish one.

116

World Anti-Doping Code • 201522.6 

 Each government will respect the autonomy of a national 
anti-doping organization in its country and not interfere 
in its operational decisions and activities.

22.7 

 A  government  should  meet  the  expectations  of  Article 
22.2 no later than 1 January 2016. The other sections of 
this Article should already have been met.

22.8 

 Failure  by  a  government  to  ratify,  accept,  approve  or 
accede to the uneSCo Convention, or to comply with the 
uneSCo Convention thereafter may result in ineligibility 
to  bid  for  events  as  provided  in  Articles  20.1.8,  20.3.11, 
and  20.6.6  and  may  result  in  additional  consequences, 
e.g.,  forfeiture  of  offices  and  positions  within  Wada; 
ineligibility  or  non-admission  of  any  candidature  to 
hold any International event in a country, cancellation of 
International  events;  symbolic  consequences  and  other 
consequences pursuant to the Olympic Charter.

[Comment to Article 22: Most  
governments cannot be parties to, or 
be bound by, private non-governmental 
instruments such as the Code. For that 
reason, governments are not asked to 
be Signatories to the Code but rather 
to sign the Copenhagen Declaration 
and ratify, accept, approve or accede 
to the UNESCO Convention. Although 
the acceptance mechanisms may be 
different, the effort to combat doping 
through the coordinated and  

harmonized program reflected in 
the Code is very much a joint effort 
between the sport movement and 
governments.

This Article sets forth what the 
Signatories clearly expect from 
governments. However, these 
are simply “expectations” since 
governments are only “obligated” to 
adhere to the requirements of the 
UNESCO Convention.]

ARTICLE 23   Acceptance, Compliance and Modification

 

 

 No  additional  provision  may  be  added  to  a  Signatory’s 
rules which changes the effect of the Articles enumerated 
in  this  Article.  A  Signatory’s  rules  must  expressly 
acknowledge  the  Commentary  of  the  Code  and  endow 
the  Commentary  with  the  same  status  that  it  has  in  
the Code. 
23.2.3 

 in  implementing  the  Code,  the  Signatories  are 
encouraged to use the models of best practice 
recommended by Wada. 

23.3 
 

Implementation of Anti-Doping Programs
 Signatories shall devote sufficient resources in order to 
implement  anti-doping  programs  in  all  areas  that  are 
compliant with the Code and the International Standards. 

23.4  Compliance with the Code
 

 Signatories  shall  not  be  considered  in  compliance  with 
the Code until they have accepted and implemented the 
Code  in  accordance  with  Articles  23.1,  23.2,  and  23.3. 
They shall no longer be considered in compliance once 
acceptance has been withdrawn.

[Comment to Article 23.2.2: Nothing in 
the Code precludes an Anti-Doping  
Organization from adopting and 
enforcing its own specific disciplinary 
rules for conduct by Athlete Support 
Personnel related to doping but which 
does not, in and of itself, constitute 

an anti-doping rule violation under 
the Code. For example, a National or 
International Federation could refuse 
to renew the license of a coach when 
multiple Athletes have committed anti-
doping rule violations while under that 
coach’s supervision.]

 Compliance  with  the  Code  shall  be  monitored 
by  Wada  or  as  otherwise  agreed  by  Wada. 
Compliance of anti-doping programs as required 
in Article 23.3 shall be monitored based on criteria 
specified  by  the  Wada  Executive  Committee. 
Compliance  with  the  commitments  reflected 
in  the  uneSCo  Convention  will  be  monitored 
as  determined  by  the  Conference  of  Parties  to 
the  uneSCo  Convention,  following  consultation 
with  the  State  Parties  and  Wada.  Wada  shall 
advise  governments  on  the 
implementation 
of  the  Code  by  the  Signatories  and  shall  advise 
Signatories  on 
the  ratification,  acceptance, 
approval or accession to the uneSCo Convention 
by governments.
 To  facilitate  monitoring,  each  Signatory  shall 
report to Wada on its compliance with the Code 
as required by the Wada Foundation Board and 
shall explain reasons for non-compliance. 
 Failure  by  a  Signatory  to  provide  compliance 
information requested by Wada for purposes of 
Article 23.5.2, or failure by a Signatory to submit 
information to Wada as required by other Articles 
of the Code, may be considered non-compliance 
with the Code.

 All Wada compliance reports shall be approved 
by  the  Wada  Foundation  Board.  Wada  shall 
dialog  with  a  Signatory  before  reporting  that 
Signatory non-compliant. Any Wada report which 
concludes that a Signatory is non-compliant must 
be approved by the Wada Foundation Board at a 
meeting held after the Signatory has been given 
an opportunity to submit its written arguments 
to  the  Foundation  Board.  The  conclusion  by  
the Wada Foundation Board that a Signatory is 
non-compliant  may  be  appealed  pursuant  to 
Article 13.6.

[Comment to Article 23.5.6: WADA 
recognizes that amongst Signatories 
and governments, there will be 
significant differences in anti-doping 
experience, resources, and the legal 

context in which anti-doping activities 
are carried out. In considering whether 
an organization is compliant, WADA

 General Application of the 2015 Code
 The 2015 Code shall apply in full as of 1 January 2015 (the 
“Effective Date”).

 Non-Retroactive except for Articles 10.7.5 and 17 or 
Unless Principle of “Lex Mitior” Applies
 The  retrospective  periods  in  which  prior  violations  can 
be considered for purposes of multiple violations under 
Article 10.7.5 and the statute of limitations set forth in 
Article  17  are  procedural  rules  and  should  be  applied

be applied retroactively if the statute of limitation period 
has not already expired by the Effective Date. Otherwise, 
with respect to any anti-doping rule violation case which 
is pending as of the Effective Date and any anti-doping 
rule violation case brought after the Effective Date based 
on  an  anti-doping  rule  violation  which  occurred  prior 
to the Effective Date, the case shall be governed by the 
substantive  anti-doping  rules  in  effect  at  the  time  the

World Anti-Doping Code • 2015APPENDIX ONE
DEFINITIONS

APPENDIX 1  Definitions

DEFINITIONS

ADAMS:  The  Anti-Doping  Administration  and  Management 
System is a Web-based database management tool for data 
entry,  storage,  sharing,  and  reporting  designed  to  assist 
stakeholders  and  Wada  in  their  anti-doping  operations  in 
conjunction with data protection legislation.

Administration: Providing, supplying, supervising, facilitating, 
or  otherwise  participating  in  the  use  or  attempted  use  by 
another Person of a Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method. 
However, this definition shall not include the actions of bona 
fide  medical  personnel  involving  a  Prohibited  Substance  or 
Prohibited  Method  used  for  genuine  and  legal  therapeutic 
purposes  or  other  acceptable  justification  and  shall  not 
include  actions  involving  Prohibited  Substances  which  are 
in  out-of-Competition  testing  unless  the 
not  prohibited 
circumstances as a whole demonstrate that such  Prohibited 
Substances are not intended for genuine and legal therapeutic 
purposes or are intended to enhance sport performance.

Adverse Analytical Finding: A report from a Wada-accredited 
laboratory or other Wada-approved laboratory that, consistent 
with the international Standard for Laboratories and related 
Technical Documents, identifies in a Sample the presence of 
a Prohibited Substance or its Metabolites or Markers (including 
elevated quantities of endogenous substances) or evidence of 
the use of a Prohibited Method. 

Adverse  Passport  Finding:  A  report  identified  as  an  adverse 
Passport  finding  as  described  in  the  applicable  International 
Standards.

Anti-Doping  Organization:  A  Signatory  that  is  responsible  for 
adopting rules for initiating, implementing or enforcing any part 
of the doping Control process. This includes, for example, the 
international Olympic Committee, the international Paralympic 
Committee, other Major event organizations that conduct testing 
at their events, Wada, international Federations, and national 
anti-doping organizations. 

130

World Anti-Doping Code • 2015Athlete: Any Person who competes in sport at the international 
level (as defined by each international Federation) or the national 
level (as defined by each national anti-doping organization). An 
anti-doping  organization  has  discretion  to  apply  anti-doping 
rules to an athlete who is neither an International-level athlete 
nor a national-level athlete, and thus to bring them within the 
definition of “Athlete.”  in relation to athletes who are neither 
International-level  nor  national-level  athletes,  an  anti-doping 
organization may elect to: conduct limited testing or no testing 
at all; analyze Samples for less than the full menu of Prohibited 
Substances;  require  limited  or  no  whereabouts  information; 
or not require advance tues. However, if an Article 2.1, 2.3 or 
2.5 anti-doping rule violation is committed by any athlete over 
whom an anti-doping organization has authority who competes 
below the international or national level, then the Consequences 
set forth in the Code (except Article 14.3.2) must be applied. For 
purposes of Article 2.8 and Article 2.9 and for purposes of anti-
doping information and education, any Person who participates 
in  sport  under  the  authority  of  any  Signatory,  government,  or 
other sports organization accepting the Code is an athlete.

[Comment to Athlete: This definition 
makes it clear that all International- 
and National-Level Athletes are 
subject to the anti-doping rules of the 
Code, with the precise definitions of 
international- and national-level sport 
to be set forth in the anti-doping rules 
of the International Federations and 
National Anti-Doping Organizations, 
respectively. The definition also 
allows each National Anti-Doping 
Organization, if it chooses to do so, 
to expand its anti-doping program 
beyond International- or National-
Level Athletes to competitors at lower 
levels of Competition or to individuals 
who engage in fitness activities but do 
not compete at all. Thus, a National 
Anti-Doping Organization could, for 
example, elect to test recreational-
level competitors but not require 

advance TUEs. But an anti-doping 
rule violation involving an Adverse 
Analytical Finding or Tampering 
results in all of the Consequences 
provided for in the Code (with the 
exception of Article 14.3.2). The 
decision on whether Consequences 
apply to recreational-level Athletes 
who engage in fitness activities but 
never compete is left to the National 
Anti-Doping Organization. In the same 
manner, a Major Event Organization 
holding an Event only for masters-level 
competitors could elect to test the 
competitors but not analyze Samples 
for the full menu of Prohibited 
Substances. Competitors at all levels 
of Competition should receive the 
benefit of anti-doping information and 
education.]

Consequences of Anti-Doping Rule Violations (“Consequences”): 
An athlete’s or other Person’s violation of an anti-doping rule 
may result in one or more of the following: (a) disqualification 
means the athlete’s results in a particular Competition or event 
are  invalidated,  with  all  resulting  Consequences  including 
forfeiture  of  any  medals,  points  and  prizes;  (b)  Ineligibility

or  Public  reporting  means  the  dissemination  or  distribution 
of information to the general public or Persons beyond those 
Persons  entitled  to  earlier  notification  in  accordance  with 
Article  14.  Teams  in  team  Sports  may  also  be  subject  to 
Consequences as provided in Article 11.

Doping Control: All steps and processes from test distribution 
planning  through  to  ultimate  disposition  of  any  appeal 
including all steps and processes in between such as provision 
of whereabouts information, Sample collection and handling, 
laboratory analysis, tues, results management and hearings.

Event: A series of individual Competitions conducted together 
under one ruling body (e.g., the Olympic games, FiNA World 
Championships, or Pan American games).

Event Venues: Those venues so designated by the ruling body 
for the event.

Event Period: The time between the beginning and end of an 
event, as established by the ruling body of the event. 

Fault:  fault  is  any  breach  of  duty  or  any  lack  of  care 
appropriate to a particular situation. Factors to be taken into 
consideration in assessing an athlete or other Person’s degree 
of  fault  include,  for  example,  the  athlete’s  or  other  Person’s 
experience,  whether  the  athlete  or  other  Person  is  a  Minor, 
special  considerations  such  as  impairment,  the  degree  of 
risk  that  should  have  been  perceived  by  the  athlete  and  the 
level  of  care  and  investigation  exercised  by  the  athlete  in 
relation to what should have been the perceived level of risk. 
in  assessing  the  athlete’s  or  other  Person’s  degree  of  fault, 
the circumstances considered must be specific and relevant 
to explain the athlete’s or other Person’s departure from the 
expected  standard  of  behavior.  Thus,  for  example,  the  fact 
that an athlete would lose the opportunity to earn large sums 
of  money  during  a  period  of  Ineligibility,  or  the  fact  that  the 
athlete only has a short time left in his or her career, or the 
timing of the sporting calendar, would not be relevant factors 
to be considered in reducing the period of Ineligibility under 
Article 10.5.1 or 10.5.2. 

[Comment to Fault: The criteria for 
assessing an Athlete’s degree of Fault 
is the same under all Articles where 
Fault is to be considered. However, 
under 10.5.2, no reduction of sanction 

is appropriate unless, when the degree 
of Fault is assessed, the conclusion is 
that No Significant Fault or Negligence 
on the part of the Athlete or other 
Person was involved.]

establishing  that  he  or  she  did  not  know  or  suspect,  and 
could not reasonably have known or suspected even with the 
exercise of utmost caution, that he or she had used or been 
administered the Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method or 
otherwise violated an anti-doping rule. Except in the case of 
a Minor, for any violation of Article 2.1, the athlete must also 
establish  how  the  Prohibited  Substance  entered  his  or  her 
system.

137

World Anti-Doping Code • 2015APPENDIX 1  Definitions

No Significant Fault or Negligence: The athlete or other Person’s 
establishing that his or her fault or negligence, when viewed 
in  the  totality  of  the  circumstances  and  taking  into  account 
the criteria for no fault or negligence, was not significant in 
relationship  to  the  anti-doping  rule  violation.  Except  in  the 
case of a Minor, for any violation of Article 2.1, the athlete must 
also establish how the Prohibited Substance entered his or her 
system. 

Out-of-Competition: Any period which is not In-Competition.

Participant: Any athlete or athlete Support Person.

Person: A natural Person or an organization or other entity. 

Possession: The actual, physical Possession, or the constructive 
Possession  (which  shall  be  found  only  if  the  Person  has 
exclusive  control  or  intends  to  exercise  control  over  the 
Prohibited  Substance  or  Prohibited  Method  or  the  premises 
in which a Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method exists); 
provided, however, that if the Person does not have exclusive 
control over the Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method or 
the  premises  in  which  a  Prohibited  Substance  or  Prohibited 
Method exists, constructive Possession shall only be found if the 
Person knew about the presence of the Prohibited Substance 
or Prohibited Method and intended to exercise control over it. 
Provided, however, there shall be no anti-doping rule violation 
based solely on Possession if, prior to receiving notification of 
any kind that the Person has committed an anti-doping rule 
violation, the Person has taken concrete action demonstrating 
that  the  Person  never  intended  to  have  Possession  and  has

Negligence: For Cannabinoids, an 
Athlete may establish No Significant 
Fault or Negligence by clearly 

demonstrating that the context 
of the Use was unrelated to sport 
performance.]

138

World Anti-Doping Code • 2015renounced  Possession  by  explicitly  declaring  it  to  an  anti-
doping organization. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
in this definition, the purchase (including by any electronic or 
other means) of a Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method 
constitutes Possession by the Person who makes the purchase.

Prohibited List: The List identifying the Prohibited Substances 
and Prohibited Methods.

Prohibited Method: Any method so described on the Prohibited 
list.

Prohibited Substance: Any substance, or class of substances, 
so described on the Prohibited list.

Provisional Hearing: For purposes of Article 7.9, an expedited 
abbreviated hearing occurring prior to a hearing under Article 
8 that provides the athlete with notice and an opportunity to be 
heard in either written or oral form. 

[Comment to Possession: Under 
this definition, steroids found in 
an Athlete’s car would constitute a 
violation unless the Athlete establishes 
that someone else used the car; in that 
event, the Anti-Doping Organization 
must establish that, even though the 
Athlete did not have exclusive control 
over the car, the Athlete knew about 
the steroids and intended to have 
control over the steroids. Similarly, 
in the example of steroids found in 
a home medicine cabinet under the 

joint control of an Athlete and spouse, 
the Anti-Doping Organization must 
establish that the Athlete knew the 
steroids were in the cabinet and 
that the Athlete intended to exercise 
control over the steroids. The act of 
purchasing a Prohibited Substance 
alone constitutes Possession, even 
where, for example, the product  
does not arrive, is received by  
someone else, or is sent to a third 
party address.]

[Comment to Provisional Hearing: 
A Provisional Hearing is only a 
preliminary proceeding which may 
not involve a full review of the facts 
of the case. Following a Provisional 
Hearing, the Athlete remains entitled 

to a subsequent full hearing on the 
merits of the case. By contrast, an 
“expedited hearing,” as that term is 
used in Article 7.9, is a full hearing on 
the merits conducted on an expedited 
time schedule.]

THE APPLICATION  

EXAMPLES OF  
OF ARTICLE 10

APPENDIX 2  Examples of the Application of Article 10

EXAMPLES OF THE APPLICATION  
OF ARTICLE 10

EXAMPLE 1
Facts: An adverse analytical finding results from the presence 
of  an  anabolic  steroid  in  an  In-Competition  test  (Article  2.1); 
the athlete promptly admits the anti-doping rule violation; the 
athlete establishes no Significant fault or negligence; and the 
athlete provides Substantial assistance.

Application of Consequences:
1.  The starting point would be Article 10.2. Because the athlete 
is deemed to have no Significant fault that would be sufficient 
corroborating evidence (Articles 10.2.1.1 and 10.2.3) that the 
anti-doping  rule  violation  was  not  intentional,  the  period  of 
Ineligibility  would  thus  be  two  years,  not  four  years  (Article 
10.2.2). 

2.  In a second step, the panel would analyze whether the fault-
related  reductions  (Articles  10.4  and  10.5)  apply.  Based  on 
no  Significant  fault  or  negligence  (Article  10.5.2)  since  the 
anabolic steroid is not a Specified Substance, the applicable 
range of sanctions would be reduced to a range of two years 
to  one  year  (minimum  one-half  of  the  two  year  sanction). 
The  panel  would  then  determine  the  applicable  period  of 
Ineligibility within this range based on the athlete’s degree of 
fault.  (Assume  for  purposes  of  illustration  in  this  example 
that the panel would otherwise impose a period of Ineligibility 
of 16 months.)

3.  in  a  third  step,  the  panel  would  assess  the  possibility  for 
suspension  or  reduction  under  Article  10.6  (reductions  not 
related to fault). in this case, only Article 10.6.1 (Substantial 
assistance) applies. (Article 10.6.3, Prompt Admission, is not 
applicable because the period of Ineligibility is already below 
the  two-year  minimum  set  forth  in  Article  10.6.3.)    Based 

144

World Anti-Doping Code • 2015on Substantial assistance, the period of Ineligibility could be 
suspended by three-quarters of 16 months.*  The minimum 
period  of  Ineligibility  would  thus  be  four  months.  (Assume 
for  purposes  of  illustration  in  this  example  that  the  panel 
suspends  ten  months  and  the  period  of  Ineligibility  would 
thus be six months.)

4.  Under  Article  10.11,  the  period  of  Ineligibility,  in  principle, 
starts  on  the  date  of  the  final  hearing  decision.  However, 
because the athlete promptly admitted the anti-doping rule 
violation, the period of Ineligibility could start as early as the 
date of Sample collection, but in any event the athlete would 
have to serve at least one-half of the Ineligibility period (i.e., 
three months) after the date of the hearing decision (Article 
10.11.2).

5.  Since  the  adverse  analytical  finding  was  committed  in  a 
Competition, the panel would have to automatically disqualify 
the result obtained in that Competition (Article 9). 

6.   According to Article 10.8, all results obtained by the athlete 
subsequent to the date of the Sample collection until the start 
of the period of Ineligibility would also be disqualified unless 
fairness requires otherwise.

7.  The information referred to in Article 14.3.2 must be Publicly 
disclosed,  unless  the  athlete  is  a  Minor,  since  this  is  a 
mandatory part of each sanction (Article 10.13).

8.  The athlete is not allowed to participate in any capacity in a 
Competition or other sport-related activity under the authority 
of any Signatory or its affiliates during the athlete’s period of 
Ineligibility (Article 10.12.1). However, the athlete may return 
to train with a team or to use the facilities of a club or other 
member  organization  of  a  Signatory  or  its  affiliates  during 
the shorter of: (a) the last two months of the athlete’s period 
of  Ineligibility,  or  (b)  the  last  one-quarter  of  the  period  of 
Ineligibility imposed (Article 10.12.2). Thus, the athlete would 
be  allowed  to  return  to  training  one  and  one-half  months 
before the end of the period of Ineligibility.

145

World Anti-Doping Code • 2015APPENDIX 2  Examples of the Application of Article 10

EXAMPLE 2
Facts: An adverse analytical finding results from the presence of 
a stimulant which is a Specified Substance in an In-Competition 
test (Article 2.1); the anti-doping organization is able to establish 
that  the  athlete  committed  the  anti-doping  rule  violation 
intentionally;  the  athlete  is  not  able  to  establish  that  the 
Prohibited Substance was used out-of-Competition in a context 
unrelated to sport performance; the athlete does not promptly 
admit the anti-doping rule violation as alleged; the athlete does 
provide Substantial assistance.

Application of Consequences:
1.  The  starting  point  would  be  Article  10.2.  Because  the  anti-
doping  organization  can  establish  that  the  anti-doping  rule 
violation  was  committed  intentionally  and  the  athlete  is 
unable to establish that the substance was permitted out-of-
Competition and the use was unrelated to the athlete’s sport 
performance (Article 10.2.3), the period of Ineligibility would 
be four years (Article 10.2.1.2). 

2.  Because the violation was intentional, there is no room for a 
reduction based on fault (no application of Articles 10.4 and 
10.5). Based on Substantial assistance, the sanction could be 
suspended by up to three-quarters of the four years.*  The 
minimum period of Ineligibility would thus be one year.

3.  Under Article 10.11, the period of Ineligibility would start on 

the date of the final hearing decision. 

4.  Since  the  adverse  analytical  finding  was  committed  in  a 
Competition,  the  panel  would  automatically  disqualify  the 
result obtained in the Competition.

5.  According to Article 10.8, all results obtained by the athlete 
subsequent  to  the  date  of  Sample  collection  until  the  start 
of the period of Ineligibility would also be disqualified unless 
fairness requires otherwise.

6.  The information referred to in Article 14.3.2 must be Publicly 
disclosed,  unless  the  athlete  is  a  Minor,  since  this  is  a 
mandatory part of each sanction (Article 10.13).

146

World Anti-Doping Code • 20157.  The athlete is not allowed to participate in any capacity in a 
Competition or other sport-related activity under the authority 
of any Signatory or its affiliates during the athlete’s period of 
Ineligibility (Article 10.12.1). However, the athlete may return 
to train with a team or to use the facilities of a club or other 
member  organization  of  a  Signatory  or  its  affiliates  during 
the shorter of: (a) the last two months of the athlete’s period 
of  Ineligibility,  or  (b)  the  last  one-quarter  of  the  period  of 
Ineligibility imposed (Article 10.12.2). Thus, the athlete would 
be allowed to return to training two months before the end of 
the period of Ineligibility.

EXAMPLE 3
Facts: An adverse analytical finding results from the presence of 
an anabolic steroid in an out-of-Competition test (Article 2.1); the 
athlete establishes no Significant fault or negligence; the athlete 
also establishes that the adverse analytical finding was caused 
by a Contaminated Product.

Application of Consequences:
1.  The starting point would be Article 10.2. Because the athlete 
can establish through corroborating evidence that he did not 
commit the anti-doping rule violation intentionally, i.e., he had 
no Significant fault in using a Contaminated Product (Articles 
10.2.1.1  and  10.2.3),  the  period  of  Ineligibility  would  be  two 
years (Article 10.2.2). 

2.  In a second step, the panel would analyze the fault-related 
possibilities for reductions (Articles 10.4 and 10.5). Since the 
athlete can establish that the anti-doping rule violation was 
caused  by  a  Contaminated  Product  and  that  he  acted  with 
no  Significant  fault  or  negligence  based  on  Article  10.5.1.2, 
the  applicable  range  for  the  period  of  Ineligibility  would  be 
reduced to a range of two years to a reprimand. The panel 
would determine the period of Ineligibility within this range, 
based on the athlete’s degree of fault. (Assume for purposes 
of illustration in this example that the panel would otherwise 
impose a period of Ineligibility of four months.)

147

World Anti-Doping Code • 2015APPENDIX 2  Examples of the Application of Article 10

3.  According to Article 10.8, all results obtained by the athlete 
subsequent to the date of Sample collection until the start of 
the period of Ineligibility would be disqualified unless fairness 
requires otherwise.

4.  The information referred to in Article 14.3.2 must be Publicly 
disclosed,  unless  the  athlete  is  a  Minor,  since  this  is  a 
mandatory part of each sanction (Article 10.13).

5.  The athlete is not allowed to participate in any capacity in a 
Competition or other sport-related activity under the authority 
of any Signatory or its affiliates during the athlete’s period of 
Ineligibility (Article 10.12.1). However, the athlete may return 
to train with a team or to use the facilities of a club or other 
member  organization  of  a  Signatory  or  its  affiliates  during 
the shorter of: (a) the last two months of the athlete’s period 
of  Ineligibility,  or  (b)  the  last  one-quarter  of  the  period  of 
Ineligibility imposed (Article 10.12.2). Thus, the athlete would 
be allowed to return to training one month before the end of 
the period of Ineligibility.

EXAMPLE 4
Facts:  An  athlete  who  has  never  had  an  adverse  analytical 
finding  or  been  confronted  with  an  anti-doping  rule  violation 
spontaneously  admits  that  she  used  an  anabolic  steroid  to 
enhance her performance. The athlete also provides Substantial 
assistance.

Application of Consequences:
1.  Since  the  violation  was  intentional,  Article  10.2.1  would  be 
applicable and the basic period of Ineligibility imposed would 
be four years.

2.  There is no room for fault-related reductions of the period of 

Ineligibility (no application of Articles 10.4 and 10.5).

3.  Based on the athlete’s spontaneous admission (Article 10.6.2) 
alone,  the  period  of  Ineligibility  could  be  reduced  by  up  to 
one-half of the four years. Based on the athlete’s Substantial 

148

World Anti-Doping Code • 2015assistance (Article 10.6.1) alone, the period of Ineligibility could 
be suspended up to three-quarters of the four years.*  Under 
Article 10.6.4, in considering the spontaneous admission and 
Substantial assistance together, the most the sanction could 
be reduced or suspended would be up to three-quarters of 
the four years. The minimum period of Ineligibility would be 
one year.

4.  The  period  of  Ineligibility,  in  principle,  starts  on  the  day  of 
the final hearing decision (Article 10.11). if the spontaneous 
admission  is  factored  into  the  reduction  of  the  period  of 
Ineligibility,  an  early  start  of  the  period  of  Ineligibility  under 
Article 10.11.2 would not be permitted. The provision seeks 
to  prevent  an  athlete  from  benefitting  twice  from  the  same 
set of circumstances. However, if the period of Ineligibility was 
suspended solely on the basis of Substantial assistance, Article 
10.11.2  may  still  be  applied,  and  the  period  of  Ineligibility 
started  as  early  as  the  athlete’s  last  use  of  the  anabolic 
steroid.

5.  According to Article 10.8, all results obtained by the athlete 
subsequent to the date of the anti-doping rule violation until 
the  start  of  the  period  of  Ineligibility  would  be  disqualified 
unless fairness requires otherwise.

6.  The information referred to in Article 14.3.2 must be Publicly 
disclosed,  unless  the  athlete  is  a  Minor,  since  this  is  a 
mandatory part of each sanction (Article 10.13).

7.  The athlete is not allowed to participate in any capacity in a 
Competition or other sport-related activity under the authority 
of any Signatory or its affiliates during the athlete’s period of 
Ineligibility (Article 10.12.1). However, the athlete may return 
to train with a team or to use the facilities of a club or other 
member  organization  of  a  Signatory  or  its  affiliates  during 
the shorter of: (a) the last two months of the athlete’s period 
of  Ineligibility,  or  (b)  the  last  one-quarter  of  the  period  of 
Ineligibility imposed (Article 10.12.2). Thus, the athlete would 
be allowed to return to training two months before the end of 
the period of Ineligibility.

149

World Anti-Doping Code • 2015APPENDIX 2  Examples of the Application of Article 10

EXAMPLE 5
Facts: An athlete Support Person helps to circumvent a period 
of  Ineligibility  imposed  on  an  athlete  by  entering  him  into  a 
Competition  under  a  false  name.  The  athlete  Support  Person 
comes forward with this anti-doping rule violation (Article 2.9) 
spontaneously  before  being  notified  of  an  anti-doping  rule 
violation by an anti-doping organization.

Application of Consequences:
1.  According  to  Article  10.3.4,  the  period  of  Ineligibility  would 
be from two up to four years, depending on the seriousness 
of the violation. (Assume for purposes of illustration in this 
example that the panel would otherwise impose a period of 
Ineligibility of three years.)

2.  There is no room for fault-related reductions since intent is 
an element of the anti-doping rule violation in Article 2.9 (see 
comment to Article 10.5.2).

3.  According to Article 10.6.2, provided that the admission is the 
only reliable evidence, the period of Ineligibility may be reduced 
down to one-half. (Assume for purposes of illustration in this 
example that the panel would impose a period of Ineligibility 
of 18 months.)

4.  The information referred to in Article 14.3.2 must be Publicly 
disclosed unless the athlete Support Person is a Minor, since 
this is a mandatory part of each sanction (Article 10.13).

EXAMPLE 6
Facts:  An  athlete  was  sanctioned  for  a  first  anti-doping  rule 
violation with a period of Ineligibility of 14 months, of which four 
months  were  suspended  because  of  Substantial  assistance. 
Now,  the  athlete  commits  a  second  anti-doping  rule  violation 
resulting  from  the  presence  of  a  stimulant  which  is  not  a 
Specified  Substance  in  an  In-Competition  test  (Article  2.1); 
the  athlete  establishes  no  Significant  fault  or  negligence;  and 
the  athlete  provided  Substantial assistance.  if  this  were  a  first 
violation, the panel would sanction the athlete with a period of 
Ineligibility of 16 months and suspend six months for Substantial 
assistance.

150

World Anti-Doping Code • 2015Application of Consequences:
1.  Article  10.7  is  applicable  to  the  second  anti-doping  rule 

violation because Article 10.7.4.1 and Article 10.7.5 apply.

2.  Under  Article  10.7.1,  the  period  of  Ineligibility  would  be  the 

greater of:
(a)  six months;
(b)  one-half of the period of Ineligibility imposed for the first 
anti-doping rule violation without taking into account any 
reduction under Article 10.6 (in this example, that would 
equal one-half of 14 months, which is seven months); or

 
 

 

 

(c)  twice the period of Ineligibility otherwise applicable to the 
second anti-doping rule violation treated as if it were a first 
violation, without taking into account any reduction under 
Article 10.6 (in this example, that would equal two times 16 
months, which is 32 months).

 Thus, the period of Ineligibility for the second violation would 
be the greater of (a), (b) and (c), which is a period of Ineligibility 
of 32 months.

3.  in  a  next  step,  the  panel  would  assess  the  possibility  for 
suspension or reduction under Article 10.6 (non-fault-related 
reductions). in the case of the second violation, only Article 
10.6.1  (Substantial assistance)  applies.  Based  on  Substantial 
assistance,  the  period  of  Ineligibility  could  be  suspended  by 
three-quarters  of  32  months.*    The  minimum  period  of 
Ineligibility would thus be eight months. (Assume for purposes 
of illustration in this example that the panel suspends eight 
months of the period of Ineligibility for Substantial assistance, 
thus reducing the period of Ineligibility imposed to two years.)
4.  Since  the  adverse  analytical  finding  was  committed  in  a 
Competition,  the  panel  would  automatically  disqualify  the 
result obtained in the Competition.

5.  According to Article 10.8, all results obtained by the athlete 
subsequent  to  the  date  of  Sample  collection  until  the  start 
of the period of Ineligibility would also be disqualified unless 
fairness requires otherwise.

151

World Anti-Doping Code • 2015APPENDIX 2  Examples of the Application of Article 10

6.  The information referred to in Article 14.3.2 must be Publicly 
disclosed,  unless  the  athlete  is  a  Minor,  since  this  is  a 
mandatory part of each sanction (Article 10.13).

7.  The athlete is not allowed to participate in any capacity in a 
Competition or other sport-related activity under the authority 
of any Signatory or its affiliates during the athlete’s period of 
Ineligibility (Article 10.12.1). However, the athlete may return 
to train with a team or to use the facilities of a club or other 
member  organization  of  a  Signatory  or  its  affiliates  during 
the shorter of: (a) the last two months of the athlete’s period 
of  Ineligibility,  or  (b)  the  last  one-quarter  of  the  period  of 
Ineligibility imposed (Article 10.12.2). Thus, the athlete would 
be allowed to return to training two months before the end of 
the period of Ineligibility.
