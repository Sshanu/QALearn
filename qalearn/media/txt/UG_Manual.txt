Introduction
The objectives of the undergraduate (UG) programmes at IIT Kanpur are:

• To provide the highest level of education in technology and science, and to produce competent,

creative, and imaginative engineers and scientists

• To promote a spirit of free and objective enquiry, and development of knowledge in diﬀerent

disciplines

• To produce highly skilled technologists and scientists with well-honed managerial and en-

trepreneurial skills having team spirit and leadership qualities

• To increase student participation in nation building through technology development that is sensitive to local needs

This manual sets out the procedures and requirements of the undergraduate programmes of study
that fall under the purview of the Senate Under-Graduate Committee (SUGC), which include B
Tech, BS, MSc, Double Major, and Dual Degree programmes. Following are the committees and
administrative units in the institute that are directly concerned with the above programmes:

Departmental Undergraduate Committee (DUGC): Each academic department constitutes this committee which consists of
a Convener nominated by the Head of the department (in consultation with the faculty of the department), Head of the
department, four to eight members of the faculty, and two student representatives. The student representatives are nominated
by the undergraduate students of the department for a one-year period. The tenure of faculty members is two years, with half
of them retiring each year (as decided by the procedure adopted by the department). The DUGC:

• Advises the students about their curriculum

• Advises them about academic opportunities

• Monitors the progress of academically weak students

• Handles any problem faced by students in their academic programmes

Senate Undergraduate Committee (SUGC): This is a standing committee formed by the Senate to look after all the issues
It makes recommendations to the senate on all academic issues including policy
regarding institute-wide UG programmes.
matters and speciﬁc problem instances related to UG students and UG programmes.
Its constituents are the conveners of
various DUGCs, PUGCs (Programme Under Graduate Conveners) where applicable, last SUGC chairperson (ex-oﬃcio), one
Senate nominee, and four student representatives nominated by Student Senate. The chairperson is elected by the constituent
members. The SUGC constitutes two subcommittees, namely, Academic Performance Evaluation Committee (APEC) and Core
Curriculum Committee (CCC). The chairpersons of these subcommittees are nominated by the SUGC chairperson, and they, in
turn, constitute their ﬁve-member committees from the faculty members of the SUGC in consultation with SUGC chairperson.
The CCC coordinates and oversees various facets of the core curriculum. The APEC evaluates the academic performance of

9

undergraduate students at the end of each semester and makes recommendations regarding their further Programme of studies
and action to be taken in the case of academically deﬁcient students. Both these subcommittees make their recommendations
to the SUGC.

programme through branch change, enhance his/her programme to a double-major or a dual-degree programme, or include a
minor in his/her existing programme. The rules governing these changes are given in Chapter 10.

2.2.1 Branch Change

A B Tech/BS student may choose to apply for a change to a B Tech/BS program in any other
discipline, including Multi-disciplinary programme (B Tech) in Engineering Sciences which is oﬀered
in two streams (i) Engineering Science (Mechanics) and (ii) Engineering Science (Energy, Environment
and Climate).

2.2.2 Double Major

This is a ﬁve year programme for a Bachelor’s degree with majors in two departments/disciplines
that oﬀer B Tech/BS degrees. The ﬁrst major is in the parent department, while the second major
is in the department to which the student is admitted for this purpose after the 4th semester.

2.2.3 Dual-Degree

Bachelors-Masters Dual Degree: This is a ﬁve-year programme in which a student earns a Bachelors and a Master’s degree.

The dual degree programme has three categories:

Category A: In this case both degrees are in the same discipline/department. The two
combinations in this category are B Tech-M Tech and BS-MS.

Category B: This is a two discipline/department programme where the Bachelor’s degree
is in the parent discipline/department and the Master’s degree is in a diﬀerent disci-
pline/department. Thus six degree combinations are possible in this category: B Tech-M
Tech, B Tech-MS, B Tech-MDES, BS- M Tech, BS-MS, and BS-MDES.

Category C: In this case the Bachelor’s degree is in the parent discipline/department and the Master’s degree is MBA.

Thus the two possible combinations are B Tech-MBA and BS-MBA.

6
MSPD Dual Degree: A 2-year MSc student may apply for a dual degree combining Masters with a
PhD in departments where this is allowed.

2.2.4 Minors

Students may include a specialization within a discipline other than their parent discipline during
the regular 4-year Bachelor’s programme. This specialization is called a Minor, and is acknowledged
as such on a student’s grade sheet. A Minor can be completed within the time and credits required
for a student’s regular 4-year Bachelors’ programme. A list of Minors available to students may be
found in the templates.

List of Courses
5.1 B Tech and BS Programmes

The entire curriculum is divided into several parts.

Institute Core (IC): This is a compulsory set of courses for all B Tech /BS student which includes basic
courses in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biological Sciences, Computing, Electronics, Engineering
Graphics, Manufacturing Processes, Communication Skills and Physical Education

ESO/SO electives: These are elective courses from a basket of Science/Engineering-Science options.

HSS electives: These are elective courses from a basket of courses in the Humanities and Social
Sciences.

Open electives (OE): These are elective courses that students may take from any department/programme in the Institute.

The only condition is that they should not do more than one course on the same topic and at the same level of coverage.

They are meant to widen the student’s knowledge beyond the parent discipline.

Departmental compulsory courses (DC): This is the compulsory set of courses for Bachelor’s
students in their parent discipline.

Departmental elective (DE): These are elective courses that students have to take from within their parent discipline.

The details of the programmes may be found in the course templates available from the DoAA website.

5.1.1 Double Major

Students who opt for a Double Major are required to complete Departmental Compulsory Courses
and, in some cases, Departmental Electives in their second major discipline, in addition to completing
all the requirements of their parent discipline. The courses taken in the second discipline will provide
a knowledge-base in this discipline which is comparable to students’ knowledge-base in their parent
discipline. The Institute Core courses and the HSS electives will be done only once. The course
templates for the double Major programme of each department may be found with the regular four
year programme templates at the DoAA website.

5.2 Bachelors-Masters Dual Degree Programme

This programme requires students to complete all their Bachelors programme requirements in addition to completing required
post-graduate courses to gain a strong foundation in their chosen Masters’ discipline. These may include seminar courses in
certain disciplines. In addition, the Masters’ part of the programme also requires a thesis or project in certain disciplines to
provide students with research experience. The course template of each department, available from the DoAA website, gives the
details of the courses and credits to be completed by the Bachelors-Masters Dual Degree students.

5.3 MSc Programme

16

This programme requires students to take a set of compulsory courses designed to lay a strong foundation in the discipline. In
addition, a few elective courses are to be credited to develop and pursue an area of specialization. In some departments there is
a project or a thesis, while in other departments projects may be replaced by elective courses. In some programmes, seminars
are also included in the curriculum. The templates of MSc programme are available from the DoAA website.

11
5.4 MSPD Dual Degree Programme

Students are required to take a set of compulsory courses designed to lay a strong foundation in the discipline. In addition,
some elective courses are to be credited to develop and pursue an area of specialization. The students are initiated into research
methodology quite early. The programme is aimed to provide young motivated individuals with rigorous training, desired level of
understanding and scientiﬁc maturity and solid base at an early stage to enable them to pursue a research career. The templates
of MSPD Dual Degree programme are available at the DoAA website.

5.5 List of Courses

Details of various courses for undergraduate programmes being oﬀered by various departments are
contained in the COURSES OF STUDY bulletin, published periodically by the Institute, and avail-
able from the DoAA website.

Chapter 6

Registration

Each admitted student is required to register before the commencement of each semester/summer to study during that period
in the Institute. New students who await the ﬁnal result of the qualifying examination are allowed to register provisionally on
submission of a certiﬁcate from their last institution stating that they have appeared in the ﬁnal examinations (both theory and
practical). Such students are required to submit documents of having passed the qualifying examination by the last date given
in the Academic Calendar, failing which their admission shall be cancelled.

There are two parts to the registration process: academic registration and administrative registration.
The responsibility for completing both parts of this process rests with the students. If a student fails
to complete the registration process within the speciﬁed time, then her/his programme shall be
terminated by the Senate.

6.1 Academic Registration

This involves the selection of courses consistent with the speciﬁc credit requirements detailed in the
programme template and subject to some rules described below. Within these rules, students have
ﬂexibility of choice regarding which courses to do within a speciﬁc semester. The academic registration
process gets completed after the DUGC convener approves the registration form. A registration is
considered valid only if there is no time-table conﬂict between the courses for which the student has
registered.

6.1.1 Pre-Registration

Every student must pre-register for the next semester at the time speciﬁed in the Academic Calendar for this purpose within
the current semester. Pre-registration is done entirely online. Students may directly register for compulsory core courses at
the time speciﬁed in the template. For core courses in semesters other than those speciﬁed in the template as well as all other
courses, students must make an online request to the concerned course instructor. If the instructor accepts the request, students
may add the course to their registration form. Otherwise, they must make a request for other course(s). Students may select
the number of courses permitted by course load rules, while ensuring that all pre-requisites have been completed and there is
no timetable clash amongst the courses. Courses with a timetable clash will be dropped automatically from students’ online
registration form. When all the courses they plan to do in the next semester have been accepted by the concerned instructors,
students need to submit the online registration form for the approval of the DUGC.

If due to an unavoidable reason, a student is unable to do academic pre-registration during the
speciﬁed period, the student should put in an application to the Chairperson SUGC for permission
to do manual ﬁnal registration at the speciﬁed time at the beginning of the semester for which the
registration is to be done. This application should be submitted to the Chairperson SUGC within a
month of the last date for academic pre-registration. If the application is approved, the student may
do manual registration during the Final Registration period.

6.1.2 Final Registration

Academic pre-registration is compulsory for all students. However, if there is a problem with a
student’s pre-registration, the student may do manual academic registration at the beginning of the
new semester on the speciﬁed day in the Academic Calendar during the Final Registration period.
Students may use the Final Registration option only under the following circumstances:

1) Their pre-registration has been cancelled.

18

2) They did not do online pre-registration at the speciﬁed time in the previous semester. In such
cases, if they do not have an oﬃcial prior permission from the Chairperson SUGC to do manual
ﬁnal registration, they will need to pay a ﬁne to avail the Final Registration option.

13
6.1.3 Add-Drop of Courses

Students may add or drop courses using the online registration system during the period speciﬁed
for this purpose in the Academic Calendar. Each add/drop request needs to be accepted by the
concerned course instructor. Once an add/drop request has been accepted, students need to change
their online registration form accordingly and submit it to the DUGC for ﬁnal approval.

Students may also request to drop course(s) up to about four weeks prior to the last date of classes (exact date is speciﬁed in

Academic Calendar) with the following conditions:

1) Dropping of course(s) should not result in the net registration becoming less than the speciﬁed

minimum number of credits for a semester.

2) The request to drop course(s) must be approved by the Instructor-in-charge of the course and the Convener, DUGC.

3) Total number of credits of courses dropped beyond the add-drop week should not exceed 44

during the entire programme. This applies to all UG programmes.

Adding of courses is not permitted in the summer term. However, students may drop a course up
to two weeks prior to the last day of classes.

6.1.4 Cancellation of Registration in a Course

Registration of a student in a course may be cancelled at any stage if it is found that s/he does not
meet the pre-requisites of the course, or if there is a clash in the student’s time table preventing
her/him from attending the course or if it is found that s/he is not eligible to register for that course
for any other reason.

An instructor of a course may also recommend cancellation of registration of any student in that course for reasons such as
absence from classes without proper authorization. The instructor may recommend such de-registration of students up to four
weeks prior to the last day of classes. The instructor should send de-registration recommendations to the SUGC Chairperson.
The same information should also be sent to the concerned DUGC. The SUGC Chairperson’s decision in each case shall be
conveyed to the instructor and the student at least two weeks prior to the last day of classes.

6.1.5 Academic Load in Regular Semesters

Each course carries a weightage in terms of credits indicating the approximate number of contact
hours (lectures and tutorials and/or laboratory hours) as well as self-study hours per week required
for the course. Credit calculation for a course is done by the following formula: C=3L+2T+P+A,

19

where C is the number of credits, L is the number of lecture hours, T is the number of tutorial hours,
P is the number of laboratory hours, and A is the additional number of hours needed for assignments
and projects, as decided at the time of approval of the course.

Normal academic load is ﬁfty credits per semester. Students may register for up to 30 percent less
or 30 percent more credits than the normal load. That is, students may register for 35-65 credits.

6.1.5.1 Exceptions to Regular Rules regarding Academic Load

Under-load: Students who are identiﬁed as academically deﬁcient (on academic probation) may
register for a minimum of 30 credits.

Over-load: In special cases students can register for courses beyond the graduation requirement.

1) Students in the advanced stage of their programme may register for extra courses (within the
65 upper credit limit) that are not part of their graduation requirements. The rules regarding
such registration are as follows:

a) Students are allowed to take extra course(s) only when they need 100 or less additional

credits to complete all the requirements of their programme.

b) Such extra course(s) may only be taken with the consent of the course instructor(s).

c) Students should submit the list of the extra course(s) to the DoAA oﬃce.

14

1) At the time of registration in the extra course(s), the student has to declare whether s/he would

do the extra course(s) on the basis of a letter Grade (A-F) or pass/fail (S/X).

2) All such extra courses will be shown on the student’s transcript.

3) If the student chooses to do the extra course(s) on the basis of a letter grade, then the letter

grade received in such extra course(s) will be counted towards SPI/CPI.

1) Any student with a CPI of 8.5 or higher may request registration for more than 65 credits in a

semester. The rules regarding such registration are as follows.

a) A student has to declare which course s/he intends to register as extra load at the time of

the registration.

20

b) If a student registers for additional load, then the total credits for that semester may be

up to 70 credits.

c) These additional courses will not count towards satisfying their graduation requirement.

d) The student may choose to take such courses on the basis of a letter grade (A-F) or
pass/fail (S/X). The grades earned in the overload courses will be shown on the student’s
transcript. But these grades will not be included in the calculation of SPI/CPI.

6.1.6 Academic Load in Summer Term

Students may register for a maximum of 25 credits in a summer term when advised by the DUGC.
The summer term is not a regular semester and only academically deﬁcient students (who have low
CPI and/or less credits than advised by the template till that point in the programme), Double
Major students, Bachelors-Masters Dual Degree students (only after their eighth semester) and such
students who are short of only one or two courses to complete all graduation requirements may register
during this period. For core courses, only students with failed backlog may be considered for summer
registration. In case any vacancies are left in the courses being oﬀered during the summer term once
the requirements of the above categories of students are fulﬁlled. Other students may register for
these courses to fulﬁll some of their graduation requirements in advance.

6.1.7 Cancellation of Registration

If a student is found to be absent from all academic activities for more than 20 working days (not necessarily contiguous) in
a semester with or without sanction, then his/her registration from all the courses in that semester will be cancelled. The
corresponding number of days of absence for a summer term is 10. In such cases, the result is a forced semester drop.

6.2 Administrative Registration

This involves two steps:

1) Payment of fees and clearance of outstanding dues (if any)

2) Signing the registration roll in the oﬃce of the Dean of Students’ Aﬀairs (DOSA)

6.3 Late Registration

Students are expected to complete the registration process (both academic and administrative) by
the date speciﬁed in the Academic Calendar. In exceptional circumstances they may be allowed to
complete the process by the date of late registration after paying the late registration fee. This fee
may be waived if prior permission for late registration is obtained. Besides, it may also be waived in
a case of unexpected events, such as illness or family emergency, when it may not be possible to take
prior permission.

Teaching and Evaluation
7.1 Teaching

7.1.1 Medium of Instruction

The medium of instruction is English. All students admitted to the ﬁrst year of the B Tech and BS
programmes are required to take a diagnostic test in English. Based on their performance, selected
students are required to credit a course in English Language and Communication Skills as a part of
their HSS course requirement.

7.1.2 Oﬀering a New Course

Any faculty member can oﬀer a new course by submitting a new-course proposal in the format described in the proposal for
new courses form available from the DoAA website. The proposal must be submitted to the concerned DUGC convener. The
convener must circulate the proposal among the entire academic staﬀ of the institute through email, requesting them to send any
feedback to the course proposer and/or the DUGC convener. Three weeks after the proposal is circulated, the course proposer
should make suitable amendments based on the feedback received. Finally the modiﬁed proposal, details of the feedback, and
details of how they were addressed must be resubmitted to the DUGC convener. The convener must forward the same with the
DUGC comments, if any, to the SUGC chairperson. A new course can be oﬀered only if it has been approved by the SUGC
before the pre-registration for the concerned semester begins.

7.1.3 Courses Oﬀerings for a Given Semester

The list of courses to be oﬀered by a department / programme in the next semester is ﬁnalised before
the pre-registration period in the current semester by the Head in consultation with the faculty. For
the summer term, this list is ﬁnalised before the registration date for the summer term. The courses to
be oﬀered are decided by taking into consideration all the requirements of the programme templates.

7.1.4 Duration of Courses

Courses may be for a full semester or half a semester. A full semester course typically has 40 lectures
of 50 minutes each or any other combination of equivalent time. Half semester courses, also called
modular courses, are taught in half of the above time.

7.1.5 Conduct of Courses

Each course is conducted by the Instructor-in-charge with the assistance of the required number of instructors, tutors, and
teaching assistants. The Instructor-in-charge is responsible for conducting the course, holding the examinations, evaluating the
performance of the students, awarding and submitting the grades to the Undergraduate oﬃce.

7.1.6 Attendance in Class

If a student remains absent from a class without sanctioned leave, then the course instructor may
recommend de-registration of the student from the course.

If a student is found to be absent from all academic activities for more than 20 working days (not
necessarily contiguous) in a semester, with or without sanction, then his/her registration for all the

22

courses in that semester will be cancelled resulting in a forced semester drop.

16
If a student is found to be absent from all academic activities in a semester without authorization
for more than 30 working days contiguous or does not appear, without a compelling reason, for the
end-semester examinations in all the courses in which she/he is registered, then her/his programme
will be terminated.

7.1.7 Work-Week and Class Timings

The institute operates on a 5-day per week schedule. Classes are held Monday through Friday from 8am to 6:30pm. No classes
are scheduled on a regular basis outside this time period. Lecture / tutorial classes are usually scheduled in 50 minute slots,
with some 75 minute slots for PG-level courses. Lab classes are usually scheduled in 180 minute slots. No classes are usually
held on Saturdays and Sundays, unless announced by DoAA as make up for some holiday.

Extra classes may be scheduled by an instructor in case the regular schedule does not allow for 40 hours of instruction (in a
lecture course), and/or if an instructor has to miss a regularly scheduled class. In such cases, the instructor may schedule an
extra class in consultation with the students registered in the course at a time mutually convenient to everyone. Extra classes
to hold a quiz or a laboratory test should not be inconveniently scheduled for any concerned student.

7.2 Evaluation and Performance Feedback

The evaluation of students’ performance in a course is a continuous process. Students’ performance is
evaluated through a mid-semester examination, an end-semester examination, quizzes (short-tests),
assignments, laboratory work (if applicable), etc. The weightage of each component to determine
the ﬁnal grade in the course is decided by the course instructor who must inform the students about
these weightages at the start of the semester.

7.2.1 Examinations

The mid-semester and end-semester examinations are scheduled by the Dean of Academic
Aﬀairs during the periods speciﬁed in the Academic Calendar.

A modular course has only one examination. It is held during the mid-semester examination period if the course is taught
during the ﬁrst half of the semester. Otherwise this exam is held during the end-semester examination period.

7.2.2 Quiz, evaluated assignments.

To ensure the principle of continuous evaluation, it is recommended that core course instructors
conduct at least two quizzes/tests, one before the mid-semester examination and other between the
mid-semester and the end–semester examination. In a core modular course, it is recommended to
have at least one quiz since it has only one examination. Schedule and number of quizzes for other
course will be decided by the instructor.

7.2.3 Make-up Examination

23

If a student, for bona ﬁde reasons such as illness, etc., fails to appear in the end-semester examina-
tions in one or more course(s), s/he may make a request to the SUGC Chairperson for a make-up
examination within a day of the last scheduled examination. Such a request must be made on the
prescribed form available from the DoAA site, giving reasons for the failure to appear in the exam-
ination along with documents supporting the given reason. In case of illness a certiﬁcate from the
Chief Medical oﬃcer of the Institute Health Center should be submitted.

If a student fails to appear in a mid-semester examination or quiz, or to submit an assignment
etc., it is entirely up to the Instructor to decide whether or not to provide a make-up opportunity.
This rule applies even if the student’s inability to do the work at the scheduled time was a result
of illness and/or sanctioned leave.

7.2.4 Results of Examinations and Quizzes

The ﬁnal grades of all the students in a course must be submitted to the DoAA within 72 hours, 96 hours, and 120 hours after
the examination for courses with class strength up to 50, between 51 and 150, and above 150 respectively. Instructors are

17
required to show the graded answer books for all examinations/quizzes/assignments as soon as pos-
sible (within 14 days of the last date of exams for the mid-semester examination, and within the
prescribed period as indicated above for the end-semester examination). It is the student’s respon-
sibility to be available at the time speciﬁed by the instructor for this purpose. Answer books of the
ﬁnal examination must be returned to the instructor after the students see them, and saved by the
instructor for a minimum of six months.

7.2.5 Letter Grades and Weightages

At the end of the semester/summer term, students are awarded a letter grade in each course by the concerned Instructor-
in-charge taking into account their performance in various examinations, quizzes, assignments, laboratory work (if any), etc.,
besides regularity of attendance in classes. In some courses such as projects, seminars, physical education etc. Satisfactory (S)

• Unsatisfactory (X) grade is awarded. Grade ‘X’ implies that the student has failed the course.

S/X grades are not used for the calculation of CPI/SPI.

Each department has its own procedure for the award of grades in project courses.

There are seven letter grades: A∗ , A, B, C, D, E and F. The letter grades, their descriptions, and
the numerical equivalents on a 10-point scale (called Grade Points) are as follows:

24

GradeGrade
Point

A
B
C
D
E

F

10
8
6
4
2

0

Excellent
Good
Fair
Pass
Fail/
Exposure
Fail

A∗ grade is intended to recognize and encourage outstanding performance in a class. This grade is to be awarded sparingly.

E grade indicates that the student has failed the course but s/he may be allowed to register for a course for which this course is
a pre-requisite, even before this course is repeated and passed. This facility of waiver of pre-requisite requirement is subject to
the approval of the instructor of the course (of which this course is pre-requisite) and the concerned DUGC.

Two additional letters, namely, ‘I’ and ‘W’, which stand for Incomplete and Waiver respectively, may be given for a course.

These are not grades.

Incomplete: A student may be awarded the letter I (Incomplete) in a course if s/he has missed,
for a genuine reason, a minor part of the course requirement but has done satisfactorily in all
other parts. An ‘I’ must, however, be converted by the Instructor-in-charge into an appropriate
letter grade and communicated to the undergraduate oﬃce by the last date speciﬁed in the
Academic Calendar. Any outstanding ‘I’ after this date shall be converted automatically into
an F grade. In case of project courses ‘I’ may not be awarded for mere non-completion of
project due to lack of facility etc.

Waiver: The letter ‘W’ is awarded when a student earns credits at another institution and
the SUGC decides to waive similar credits from her/his programme of study at IIT Kanpur.
The grade earned in lieu of which the waiver is granted is not to be used for computation of
SPI/CPI.

7.2.6 Semester Performance Index

The Semester Performance Index (SPI) is a weighted average of the grade points earned by a student in all the courses credited
in a semester. If the grade points associated with the awarded grades to a student are g1, g2 ...
in a given semester and the
corresponding course credits are c1, c2,.... , then the SPI for that semester is calculated by multiplying the number of

18
credits for each course with the grade point for that course, adding these up for all the courses
registered in the semester, and then dividing this sum by the total course credits for the semester:

25

=

×

∈

26

S and X grades shall not be considered in the computation of the SPI.

7.2.7 Cumulative Performance Index

The Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) indicates the overall academic performance of a student.
It is computed in the same manner as the SPI, except that here we consider all the courses registered
up to and including the latest completed semester/summer term.

=

×

27

∈

Whenever a student is permitted to repeat or substitute a course, the new letter grade replaces
the old letter grade in the computation of the CPI, but both grades are mentioned in the Grade
Report.

7.2.8 Declaration of the Final Result

The grades earned by a student in a semester/summer term shall be communicated to her/him after
ten days of the last date for submission of grades. A printed copy of the Grade Report will be issued
to each student after each semester/summer term. A duplicate copy, if required, can be obtained on
payment of the prescribed fee.

7.2.9 Withholding of Grades

The grades of a student may be withheld if s/he has not paid her/his dues, or if there is a case of
indiscipline pending against her/him, or for any other appropriate reason as per the directives of
the Senate.

7.2.10 Change of an already awarded grade

28

A letter grade once awarded shall not be changed unless the request is made by either the Instructor-
in-charge or another Instructor/tutor of the course, and is approved by the Chairperson, Senate. Any
such request for a change of grade must be made within six weeks of the start of the next semester
on the prescribed form available from the DoAA website, with all relevant records and justiﬁcations.

The minimum and maximum duration allowed will include any semester(s) in which a student is registered at IITK, but may
spend as a non-degree student at some other Institution while still pursuing the said academic programme at IITK.

29

The Senate may grant relaxation in the prescribed minimum residence to a student in view of the
work done by her/him in the Institute or elsewhere, to the extent considered appropriate according
to the merit of the case.

A student failing to complete the programme even within the maximum duration speciﬁed may be
allowed by the Senate to continue depending on the merits of the case.

8.2 Minimum Academic Requirement

In order to graduate, a student must clear all courses as per the respective programme template, satisfying the minimum credit
requirement in each course category. In addition, a Bachelors-Masters dual-degree student must achieve at least 6.5 CPI in the
PG part of the programme, and MSc or MSPD dual degree student (in MSc part) must achieve at least 6.0 CPI. For students
admitted to the MSc Integrated programme (discontinued in 2011), the minimum graduation CPI is 5.0.

If a student is short of 1 credit in the SO/ESO category for the completion of the programme, then
s/he may be granted relaxation for the same by the SUGC. In exceptional circumstances Senate may
grant any other relaxation in minimum academic requirements.

8.3 Graduation

A student is deemed to have completed the requirements for graduation if s/he has:

1) Met the minimum duration and academic requirements outlined in Sections 8.1 and 8.2

2) Satisﬁed additional requirements, if any, of the concerned department

3) Paid all dues to the Institute and the Halls of Residence

4) No case of indiscipline is pending against her/him

8.3.1 Graduation with Distinction

A student graduating with a CPI of 8.5 or above is said to graduate with distinction. This fact is
noted on the student’s ﬁnal grade report.

20
8.4 Award of Degrees

A student who completes all the graduation requirements speciﬁed in Section 8.3 is recommended
by the Senate to the Board of Governors (BOG) for award of the appropriate degree in the ensuing
convocation. The degree can be awarded only after the BOG accords its approval.

30

8.5 Withdrawal of the Degree

Under extremely exceptional circumstances, where gross violation of graduation requirements is
detected at a later stage, the Senate may recommend to the Board of Governors withdrawal of a
degree already awarded.

Chapter 9

Inadequate Academic Performance

9.1 Mechanism to Address Inadequate Performance

A student is expected to maintain at least a minimum level of performance at all times. The
academic performance of each UG student is reviewed by the Academic Performance Evaluation
Committee (APEC) at the end of each regular semester. A deﬁcient student may be placed on
Warning or Academic Probation or his/her academic programme may be terminated as per rules
applicable for that particular batch. A student on Warning or Academic Probation is required to
sign an undertaking incorporating the following conditions:

1) S/he shall register with higher priority for those courses (or their substitute) in which grade

F/E/X is obtained

2) S/he shall not hold any oﬃce in the Hall of Residence, Students Gymkhana or any other

organization/body

3) Any other terms and conditions laid down by the SUGC/Senate

The parents/guardian of these students is required to countersign this undertaking. If a student is unable to meet these terms
and conditions due to some genuine reasons, s/he must explain this to the DUGC/SUGC before the semester ends.

The criteria for placing students on Warning, Academic Probation, and Programme Termination are described in the following
sections. Here N denotes the number of semesters for which the student has registered, SC denotes the number of credits
completed in the last regular semester, and TC denotes the number of credits completed in all the semesters till that point.

Students in the PhD part of the MSPD dual degree programme will be governed by PG rules.

9.5 Appeal Against Termination

A student whose programme is terminated may appeal to the Chairperson, Senate, for re-reinstatement
in the programme. In cases of termination due to inadequate academic performance, the student
should clearly explain causes for the poor performance, including how those causes will not adversely
aﬀect her/his performance in the future. The Senate shall take a ﬁnal decision after considering all
available inputs. A student may re-appeal even after a previous appeal has been rejected. However,
the Senate may not entertain any re-appeal for review unless substantial additional information is
brought to its notice.

44

1) The vacancies in various programs, and allotment of branch changes, will be computed irre-
spective of all categories, except where Senate has speciﬁcally mandated the preference to be
given to speciﬁc categories (GN/SC/ST/OBC/PD etc.).

2) Seat availability will be calculated such that no programme exceeds the larger of E and S +
2, where E is its existing and S is the sanctioned strength. At the same time, no programme
should fall below 55% of its sanctioned strength as the result of branch change allotments.

3) Existing and Sanctioned strength of a programme are calculated as follows:

Existing Strength of batch is L + A – T, where

L = Number of students registered on the last date of the semester

A = Number of students who are on authorized leave for that semester

T = Number of students whose programs have been terminated at the end of that
semester, and whose appeals have not been accepted by Senate.

Sanctioned strength for batch is St + E + C, where

St = Larger of the sanctioned strength approved by Senate and the actual number of students admitted

E = Number of extra seat(s) created by Senate for this batch in the previous semester(s)

C = Number of extra seat(s) created by Senate as special cases in previous semester(s)

Note

1) Seats fallen vacant in the parent department due to seats created in other department for branch
change of students securing 10.0 CPI will be considered as vacant for the purpose of branch
change.

2) Seats fallen vacant in the parent department due to TIE among two or more students given branch change/permanent
withdrawal by any student or due to death of any student will be considered as vacant for the purpose of branch change.

3) Seat of terminated student will be considered as vacant for the purpose of branch change only

after Senate has turned down her/his appeal or the student has not appealed.

4) Extra seats created for students securing 10.0 CPI and/or for allotting to the students among

TIE, shall not be added to the actual sanctioned strength for the purpose of branch change.

10.6.4 Minor

If the ﬁrst course of a Minor programme in a department is a compulsory departmental course then
the number of students admitted per year in that Minor programme will be at least (i) 10 or (ii) 20%
of the department’s existing batch strength, whichever is smaller.

If the ﬁrst course of the Minor is not a compulsory department course, the department will admit up
to 20% of its existing batch strength. If the number of students exceeds the number that a department
can accommodate, the department should clearly state the criterion it is going to apply to limit the
number of students. This limitation in number of students applies only in the ﬁrst course of a Minor.
In subsequent courses this limit does not apply to students who have already been admitted to the
Minor.

Leave of Absence
11.1 Mid-Semester Recess and Vacation

Undergraduate students are entitled to avail the mid-semester recess, winter and summer vacations
as speciﬁed in the Academic Calendar without seeking any permission.

11.2 Short Leave

Leave of absence during the semester is discouraged for all registered students. However, for bona ﬁde reasons, a student may
apply for leave using the online registration system. The extent of this leave for medical reasons can be a maximum of ten
working days. A maximum of ﬁve working days of leave may also be granted for any other valid reason. In no case may a
student be granted leave of absence in excess of ﬁfteen working days in a semester.

The leave of absence in the summer term shall correspondingly be ﬁve working days (medical) and
three working days (others), i.e., eight working days total.

Application for leave of absence may be submitted online through OARS.

11.3 Temporary Withdrawal/ Semester Leave

1) A student may be allowed a leave of absence for a whole semester (temporary withdrawal)
for bona ﬁde reasons. Such leave of absence shall ordinarily not exceed two semesters with or
without break during the entire period of the academic programme.

2) An application for temporary withdrawal should be made before the date of registration for the
semester as mentioned in the Academic Calendar. However, under exceptional circumstances,
a student may apply for withdrawal anytime during the semester.

3) Application for temporary withdrawal should be addressed to the Chairperson, SUGC, and
routed through the DUGC convener. It should be submitted to the Undergraduate oﬃce with
supporting documents such as a medical certiﬁcate (in original) in case of an illness.

4) A student who remains on authorized leave of absence due to ill health shall be required to
submit a certiﬁcate from a Registered Medical Practitioner to the eﬀect that s/he is suﬃciently
cured and is ﬁt to resume her/his studies. The Institute may constitute a Medical Board to
determine the ﬁtness of the student before registration. The registration of the student shall
be provisional till the Board certiﬁes the ﬁtness. In the event that the Board recommends that
the student is not yet ﬁt to resume studies, the registration may be cancelled.

11.4 Penalty for Unsanctioned or Excessive Leave

If a student is found to be absent from class without sanctioned leave, then the course instructor
may recommend de-registration of the student from the course. The policy regarding unsanctioned

49

leave leading to de-registration or any other consequence must be declared by the instructor at the
beginning of the course. This rule applies to regular as well as modular courses and in regular
semesters as well as in the summer term.

If a student is found to be absent from a majority of lectures, tutorials and laboratory sessions for more than 20 working days
(not necessarily contiguous) in a semester, with or without sanction, then her/his registration for all the courses in that semester
may be cancelled by Senate on recommendation of SUGC resulting in a forced semester drop.

If a student is found to be absent from all academic activities in a semester without authorization for
more than 30 working days contiguously or s/he does not appear, without a compelling reason, for
the end-semester examinations in all the courses in which s/he is registered, then her/his programme
will be terminated.

31
11.5 Permission to proceed to other Institutions

In order to help students to broaden their horizons and gain course-work experience, they may be
permitted to proceed to other academic institutions in India or abroad as a non-degree student. The
following guidelines and procedures apply for this purpose:

1) A student who satisﬁes the minimum eligibility conditions given below may spend up to two
semesters and/or two summer terms in any academic institution of repute in India or abroad
with prior permission of the SUGC.

2) The semester spent as a non-degree student will be counted as a part of the time spent in pursuit of the degree.

11.5.1 Eligibility

1) Completion of 200 credits of course work

2) CPI of at least 7.0

11.5.2 Application Procedure

1) The student shall make an application to SUGC through the concerned DUGC, giving details
of the proposed programme and shall submit a statement of purpose with suﬃcient information
about the Institution where s/he has chosen to spend time as a non-degree student.

2) The DUGC shall examine the student’s proposal to determine whether the proposed programme

is of a nature that the student will beneﬁt from the exposure.

3) On the recommendation of the DUGC, SUGC may approve the proposal and grant permis-
sion, with leave of absence, to the student to proceed as a non-degree student to the selected
Institution.

50

4) Any application for waiver of credits at IIT Kanpur or transfer of credits from the other Insti-

tution shall be decided in accordance with the procedure given in section 11.5.3.

11.5.3 Transfer of Credits and Waiver in-lieu thereof

1) Permission to proceed to another institution as a non-degree student does not imply that the student will automatically

get waiver from the academic and other requirements of her/his ongoing undergraduate programme at the Institute.

2) On return, s/he may apply for waiver of courses from her/his program template which s/he
thinks are equivalent to the courses successfully completed at the visited Institute as a non-
degree student. With the application the student must submit an oﬃcial transcript of the
grades obtained by her/him at the visited Institute as a non-degree student and other docu-
ments/material that the concerned DUGC may require for evaluation. The DUGC will deter-
mine, by whatever means it deems ﬁt, the equivalent courses (credits) and/or requirements for
which the student may be given a waiver in her/his undergraduate programme at IIT Kanpur.

3) On the recommendation of the DUGC, SUGC may allow a student a waiver for a maximum of

100 credits against the course work completed elsewhere as a non-degree student.

4) Against each course or requirement for which a waiver is granted, symbol "W" would appear on the Grade Report with
an explanatory note that it stands for waiver granted due to courses taken and/or work done at the selected Institution
elsewhere. All such courses and/or requirements will be deemed to carry zero credits for SPI/CPI calculation.

5) Under no conditions will the grades earned at any other Institution appear on the Grade Report.

Those students who are selected by the Institute, using prescribed rules and procedures, to proceed on any Institutional exchange
programme will also be governed by these clauses for the transfer of academic credits, waiver, etc.

Conduct and Discipline
13.1 Code of Conduct

Students are expected to conduct themselves with integrity and proper consideration for others at
all times. Students are expected to exhibit proper respect for others in their personal behavior
and interpersonal interactions, both within and outside the campus. The institute strictly prohibits
ragging and sexual harassment; any instance of either should be reported immediately and will be
dealt with as a serious oﬀense.

In academic matters, absolute honesty is mandatory. The institute has a zero tolerance policy for any
adoption of unfair means during examinations. In every other respect also, students are expected to
do their academic work with integrity, with proper acknowledgement if material from other sources is
included in their own work. Plagiarism, whether intended or not, is an act of academic dishonesty and
penalized as such. If there is any doubt about what constitutes plagiarism, students should consult
their instructors to ensure maintenance of academic honesty in their work. Any case of cheating will
be dealt with strictly by the Institute.

Students are expected to respect Institute property and follow all institute rules and regulations at
all times.

If students feel victimized by the conduct, academic or personal, of any other member of the Institute,
they may register a complaint with the Ombudsperson for whom the contact information is available
from the DoSA website.
In case of any complaint related to sexual harassment, students should
contact the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) or Women’s Cell (women_cell@iitk.ac.in).

13.2 Disciplinary Action and Related Matters

Any violation of the Code of Conduct shall invite disciplinary action which may include punishments
such as reprimand, disciplinary probation, ﬁne, debarring from examinations, withdrawal of schol-
arship and/or placement services, withholding of grades and/or degrees, cancellation of registration
and even expulsion from the Institute. In certain cases, the student may be barred from applying for
a change of programme.

The Instructor-in-Charge of a course may debar a student from the examination in which s/he is
detected to be using unfair means. The Instructor/Tutor may take appropriate action against a
student who misbehaves in her/his class.
In all such cases, the Instructor/Tutor shall inform the
DoAA oﬃce of all concerned information for record.

The Warden-in-Charge of a Hall of Residence may reprimand, impose ﬁne or take any other suitable
measure against a resident who violates either the Code of Conduct or rules and regulations pertaining
to the concerned Hall of Residence. In all such cases, the Warden-in-Charge shall inform the DoSA
oﬃce of all the details for record.

Involvement of a student in ragging may lead to his/her expulsion from the Institute.

53

The Senate Student Aﬀairs Committee (S-SAC) investigates alleged misdemeanors, complaints, etc. and recommends a suitable
course of action. Violation of the Code of Conduct by an individual or of a group of students can be referred to this committee
by a student, teacher or other functionary of the Institute. Further, in exceptional circumstances, the Chairperson, Senate, may
appoint a special committee to investigate and/or recommend appropriate action for any act of gross indiscipline involving an
individual or a number of students, which, in her/his view, may tarnish the image of the Institute.

The recommendations of S-SAC are submitted to Chairperson, Senate for approval. In cases when
the expulsion of a student from the Institute has been recommended, the matter is sent to the Senate
for the ﬁnal decision.

A student, who feels aggrieved with the punishment awarded, may appeal to the Chairperson, Senate,
stating clearly the case and explaining her/his position, and seeking reconsideration of the decision.

34
The Senate may not recommend a student who is found guilty of a major oﬀense to the Board of
Governors for the award of a degree/diploma/certiﬁcate even if s/he has satisfactorily completed all
the academic requirements.

Here are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions regarding UG programmes:

Q.1 Do I have to register for courses strictly as per the template?

Course templates are advisory in terms of when speciﬁc courses need to be done. However, for
compulsory Institute core courses, there is no guarantee that the instructor will allow you to register

55

if you are taking it at a time other than the one speciﬁed in the template. For ESO and HSS, you may
shift around courses, depending on their availability. For Department Core and Department Electives,
please consult your DUGC before shifting any slots. You will NOT be automatically entitled to any
required course if you are not taking it in the scheduled semester. Also, you need to ensure that you
complete any pre-requisites in time to do the succeeding courses.

Q.2 What happens if I do not do academic pre-registration?

You may do academic registration during Final Registration as speciﬁed in the Academic Calendar
after paying a penalty fee for not doing academic pre-registration.
In special circumstances this
penalty fee may be waived by the SUGC if you apply for such a waiver within one month of the
conclusion of the pre-registration period.

Q.3 When and how can I apply for branch change?

You may apply for Branch Change at the end of your second, third, or fourth semester. The DoAA
oﬃce will send out a call for applications, and you need to apply on the speciﬁed form by the given
deadline.

Q.4 When and how can I apply for Double Major, Dual Degree or Minor?

Double Major: At the end of your fourth semester if you have a CPI of 7.0 or above.

Dual Degree: For category A (within the same department), at the end of your ﬁfth, sixth, or seventh
semesters; for category B/C (in another department/programme), at the end of your sixth semester
only.

MSPD Dual Degree: Students in the departments oﬀering this programme may apply after the second or third semester if they
have a CPI of 7.0 or above. Details regarding the application process should be conﬁrmed from the DUGC.

Minor: During your fourth, ﬁfth or sixth semester. The DOAA oﬃce will send out calls for applications at appropriate times,
and you need to apply on the speciﬁed forms by the given deadline. You CANNOT apply for a Minor if you are doing a Double
36
Major, though you may claim a retrospective Minor if you manage to complete all the required courses
without ever being admitted to the Minor oﬃcially.

Q.5 How are grades determined in a course?

Each instructor will announce the course’s grading policy at the beginning of the semester.

Q.6 What is the passing grade, and what is the minimum CPI for graduation?

The passing grade is D. For all B Tech /BS programmes, the only graduation requirement is successful
completion of all the credit requirements speciﬁed in your template. For MSc 2-year, graduation
requirement is completion of all required courses and a minimum CPI of 6.0. For all dual-degree
students, the graduation requirements for the PG part of the programme are as per the PG manual.

Q.7 Can I repeat a course to improve my grade?

56

No, if you have passed a course with a D grade, you may not repeat it. You are required to repeat a
course if you receive an E or F grade in it, since both are failing grades.

Q.8 Can I drop a course if I am not performing well in it?

You may request a course drop until the last date speciﬁed for this in the Academic Calendar. However, a course drop request
will be accepted only if it is approved by the course instructor-in-charge as well as the DUGC convener.

Q.9 Can I take courses in the summer term?

Summer courses are primarily for clearing backlogs to ensure timely graduation and for Double
Major / Bachelors-Masters Dual Degree students. If any seats are left over in the oﬀered courses
after admitting all students in the above categories, they may be given to students who are attempting
to do courses in advance.

Q.10 Can I take leave during a semester?

In a semester, you may apply online for a maximum of 10 days of leave for bona ﬁde medical reasons,
and a maximum of 5 days for family emergencies. You are responsible for making up any missed
work during this period; the instructor is not obliged to provide any make-up assignments, quizzes,
exams, etc. for those missed while you are on leave. For end-semester examinations, a make-up will
be provided for those with CMO (IITK Chief Medical Oﬃcer) certiﬁed leave or any other compelling
reason for absence during the exam period.
