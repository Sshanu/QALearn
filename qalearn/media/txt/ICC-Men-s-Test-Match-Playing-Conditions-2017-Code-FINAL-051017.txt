ICC Men’s Test Match Playing Conditions  

(incorporating the 2017 Code of the MCC Laws of Cricket) 

Preamble - The Spirit of Cricket 

Cricket  owes  much  of its  appeal  and  enjoyment  to  the  fact  that  it should  be  played  not only  according  to the  Laws 
(which are incorporated within these Playing Conditions), but also within the Spirit of Cricket.  

The  major  responsibility  for  ensuring  fair  play  rests  with  the  captains,  but  extends  to  all  players,  umpires  and, 
especially in junior cricket, teachers, coaches and parents. 

Respect is central to the Spirit of Cricket. 

Respect your captain, team-mates, opponents and the authority of the umpires. 

Play hard and play fair. 

Accept the umpire’s decision. 

Create a positive atmosphere by your own conduct, and encourage others to do likewise. 

Show self-discipline, even when things go against you. 

Congratulate the opposition on their successes, and enjoy those of your own team. 

Thank the officials and your opposition at the end of the match, whatever the result. 

Cricket is an exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship and teamwork, which brings together people from 
different nationalities, cultures and religions, especially when played within the Spirit of Cricket. 

1  THE PLAYERS 

1.1 

Number of players 

A match is played between two sides, each of eleven players, one of whom shall be captain. 

1.2 

Nomination and replacement of players 

1.2.1 

Each captain shall nominate 11 players plus a maximum of 6 substitute fielders in writing to the ICC Match 
Referee before the toss. No player (member of the playing eleven) may be changed after the nomination 
without the consent of the opposing captain. 

1.2.2  Only those nominated as substitute fielders shall be entitled to act as substitute fielders during the match, 

unless the ICC Match Referee, in exceptional circumstances, allows subsequent additions. 

1.2.3 

1.2.4 

All those nominated including those nominated as substitute fielders, must be eligible to play for that 
particular team and by such nomination the nominees shall warrant that they are so eligible. 

In addition, by their nomination, the nominees shall be deemed to have agreed to abide by all the applicable 
ICC Regulations pertaining to international cricket and in particular, the Clothing and Equipment 
Regulations, the Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel (hereafter referred to as the 
ICC Code of Conduct), the Anti-Racism Code for Players and Player Support Personnel, the Anti-Doping 
Code and the Anti-Corruption Code. 

1.2.5 

A player or player support personnel who has been suspended from participating in a match shall not, from 
the toss of the coin and for the remainder of the match thereafter: 

1 

 

1.2.5.1 

Be nominated as, or carry out any of the duties or responsibilities of a substitute fielder, or 

1.2.5.2 

Enter any part of the playing area (which shall include the field of play and the area between the boundary 
and the perimeter boards) at any time, including any scheduled or unscheduled breaks in play. 

A player who has been suspended from participating in a match shall be permitted from the toss of the coin 
and for the remainder of the match thereafter be permitted to enter the players’ dressing room provided that 
the players’ dressing room (or any part thereof) for the match is not within the playing area described in 
clause 1.2.5.2 above (for example, the player is not permitted to enter the on-field ‘dug-out’) 

1.3 

Captain 

1.3.1 

If at any time the captain is not available, a deputy shall act for him. 

1.3.2 

1.3.3 

If a captain is not available to nominate the players, then any person associated with that team may act as 
his deputy to do so. See clause 1.2. 

At any time after the nomination of the players, only a nominated player can act as deputy in discharging the 
duties and responsibilities of the captain as stated in these Playing Conditions, including at the toss. See 
clause 13.4(The toss). 

1.3.4 

Each Member Board must nominate its ‘Test Team Captain’ to the ICC when appointed. 

1.3.5 

1.3.6 

If the ‘Test Team Captain’ is not participating in a series, the relevant Home Board must nominate a 
replacement ‘Test Team Captain’ for the series. The Home Board shall advise the series Match Referee. 

If the ‘Test Team Captain’ plays in a match without being the nominated captain for that match, he will be 
deemed to be the captain should any penalties be applied for over rate breaches under the ICC Code of 
Conduct. 

1.4 

Responsibility of captains 

The captains are responsible at all times for ensuring that play is conducted within the Spirit of Cricket, as well as 
within these Playing Conditions. 

2  THE UMPIRES 

2.1 

Appointment and attendance 

The following rules for the selection and appointment of Test Match umpires shall be followed as far as it is 
practicable to do so: 

2.1.1 

The umpires shall control the game as required by these Playing Conditions, with absolute impartiality and 
shall be present at the ground at least two hours before the scheduled start of the first day’s play, and at 
least 1.5 hours before the scheduled start of each succeeding day’s play. 

2.1.2 

The ICC shall establish an ‘Elite Panel’ of umpires who shall be contracted to the ICC. 

2.1.3 

2.1.4 

2.1.5 

2.1.6 

Each Full Member shall nominate from its panel of first class umpires up to four umpires to an ‘International 
Panel’. 

The ICC shall appoint the two on-field umpires to stand in each Test Match. Neither of the umpires shall be 
from the same country as the participating teams and shall be selected from the Elite Panel or the 
International Panel. 

As early as possible before each Test Match, the ICC will advise the Home Board of the names of its 
appointees and the Home Board will advise the Manager of the visiting team of all umpires’ names. 

In Test Matches where the DRS is used, the ICC will appoint a third umpire who shall act as the emergency 
on-field umpire and officiate in regard to the DRS. Such third umpire shall not be from the same country as 
the participating teams and shall be appointed from the Elite Panel or the International Panel. 

2 

 

2.1.7 

In all other Test Matches, the third umpire will be appointed by the Home Board and shall act as the 
emergency on-field umpire and officiate in regard to TV replays. Such appointment shall be made from the 
Elite Panel or the International Panel. 

2.1.7.1 

The playing conditions governing the use of the DRS and the third umpire are included in Appendix D. 

2.1.8 

The Home Board shall also appoint a fourth umpire for each Test Match from its panel of first class umpires. 
The fourth umpire shall act as the emergency third umpire. In ‘DRS’ Test Matches the fourth umpire shall be 
appointed from the “International Panel”. 

2.1.9 

The ICC shall appoint the match referee for all matches (ICC Match Referee). 

2.1.10  The ICC Match Referee shall not be from the same country as the participating teams. 

2.1.11  Neither team will have a right of objection to the appointment of any umpire or match referee. 

2.2 

Change of umpire 

An umpire shall not be changed during the match, other than in exceptional circumstances, unless he/she is injured 
or ill. 

2.3 

Consultation with Home Board 

Before the match the umpires shall consult with the Home Board to determine: 

2.3.1 

the balls to be used during the match. See clause 4 (The ball). 

2.3.2 

the hours of play and the times and durations of any agreed intervals.  

2.3.3 

which clock or watch and back-up time piece is to be used during the match. 

2.3.4 

the boundary of the field of play. See clause 19 (Boundaries). 

2.3.5 

the use of covers. See clause 10 (Covering the pitch). 

2.3.6 

any special conditions of play affecting the conduct of the match. 

2.4 

The wickets, creases and boundaries 

Before the toss and during the match, the umpires shall satisfy themselves that 

2.4.1 

the wickets are properly pitched. See clause 8 (The wickets). 

2.4.2 

the creases are correctly marked. See clause 7 (The creases). 

2.4.3 

the boundary of the field of play complies with the requirements of clauses 19.1 (Determining the boundary 
of the field of play), 19.2 (Identifying and marking the boundary) and 19.3 (Restoring the boundary). 

2.5 

Conduct of the match, implements and equipment 

Before the toss and during the match, the umpires shall satisfy themselves that 

2.5.1 

the conduct of the match is strictly in accordance with these Playing Conditions. 

2.5.2 

the implements used in the match conform to the following 

2.5.2.1 

clause 4 (The ball). 

2.5.2.2 

externally visible requirements of clause 5 (The bat) and paragraph 1 of Appendix B. 

2.5.2.3 

either clauses 8.2 (Size of stumps) and 8.3 (The bails). 

2.5.3 

no player uses equipment other than that permitted. See paragraph 2 of Appendix A. Note particularly 
therein the interpretation of ‘protective helmet’. 

2.5.4 

the wicket-keeper’s gloves comply with the requirements of clause 27.2 (Gloves). 

3 

 

2.6 

Fair and unfair play 

The umpires shall be the sole judges of fair and unfair play. 

2.7 

Fitness for play 

2.7.1 

It is solely for the umpires together to decide whether either conditions of ground, weather or light or 
exceptional circumstances mean that it would be dangerous or unreasonable for play to take place. 

Conditions shall not be regarded as either dangerous or unreasonable merely because they are not ideal. 

The fact that the grass and the ball are wet does not warrant the ground conditions being regarded as 
unreasonable or dangerous. 

Conditions shall be regarded as dangerous if there is actual and foreseeable risk to the safety of any player 
or umpire. 

Conditions shall be regarded as unreasonable if, although posing no risk to safety, it would not be sensible 
for play to proceed. 

If the umpires consider the ground is so wet or slippery as to deprive the bowler of a reasonable foothold, 
the fielders of the power of free movement, or the batsmen of the ability to play their strokes or to run 
between the wickets, then these conditions shall be regarded as so bad that it would be dangerous and 
unreasonable for play to take place. 

2.7.2 

2.7.3 

2.7.4 

2.8 

Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable circumstances 

2.8.1 

All references to ground include the pitch. See clause 6.1 (Area of pitch). 

2.8.2 

2.8.3 

If at any time the umpires together agree that the conditions of ground, weather or light, or any other 
circumstances are dangerous or unreasonable, they shall immediately suspend play, or not allow play to 
start or to recommence. The decision as to whether conditions are so bad as to warrant such action is one 
for the umpires alone to make, following consultation with the ICC Match Referee. 

If circumstances are warranted, the umpires shall stop play and instruct the Ground Authority to take 
whatever action they can and use whatever equipment is necessary to remove as much dew as possible 
from the outfield when conditions become unreasonable or dangerous. The umpires may also instruct the 
ground staff to take such action during scheduled and unscheduled breaks in play. 

2.8.4 

The umpires shall disregard any shadow on the pitch from the stadium or from any permanent object on the 
ground. 

2.8.5 

Light Meters 

It is the responsibility of the ICC to supply light meters to the match officials to be used in accordance with 
these playing conditions. 

2.8.5.1 

All light meters shall be uniformly calibrated. 

2.8.5.2 

The umpires shall be entitled to use light meter readings as a guideline for determining whether the light is 
fit for play in accordance with the criteria set out in clause 2.8.2 above. 

2.8.5.3 

Light meter readings may accordingly be used by the umpires: 

2.8.5.3.1 

To determine whether there has been at any stage a deterioration or improvement in 
the light. 

2.8.5.3.2 

As benchmarks for the remainder of the match. 

2.8.6 

Use of artificial lights 

If in the opinion of the umpires, natural light is deteriorating to an unfit level, they shall authorize the Ground 
Authority to use the available artificial lighting so that the match can commence or continue in acceptable 
conditions. 

4 

 

In the event of power failure or lights malfunction, the provisions relating to the delay or interruption of play 
due to bad weather or light shall apply. 

Home Boards may, prior to the commencement of the series, seek the approval of the ICC to amend this 
playing condition to provide that artificial lights will not be used at specific venues. 

For day/night Test matches, the latest times at which the floodlights are to be switched on each day shall be 
decided by the Home Board prior to the match and the ICC Match Referee shall be duly informed. 

2.8.7  When there is a suspension of play it is the responsibility of the umpires to monitor conditions. They shall 

make inspections as often as appropriate, unaccompanied by any players or officials. Immediately the 
umpires together agree that the conditions are no longer dangerous or unreasonable they shall call upon the 
players to resume play. 

2.8.8 

The safety of all persons within the ground is of paramount importance to the ICC. In the event that of any 
threatening circumstance, whether actual or perceived (including for example weather, pitch invasions, act 
of God, etc.), then the umpires, on the advice of the ICC Match Referee, should suspend play and all 
players and officials should immediately be asked to leave the field of play in a safe and orderly manner and 
to relocate to a secure and safe area (depending on each particular threat) pending the satisfactory passing 
or resolution of such threat or risk to the reasonable satisfaction of the umpires, the ICC Match Referee, the 
head of the relevant Ground Authority, the head of ground security and/or the police as the circumstances 
may require. 

2.8.9  Where play is suspended under clause 2.8.8 above the decision to abandon or resume play shall be the 

responsibility of the ICC Match Referee who shall act only after consultation with the head of ground security 
and the police. 

2.9 

Position of umpires 

The umpires shall stand where they can best see any act upon which their decision may be required. 

Subject to this over-riding consideration, the bowler’s end umpire shall stand in a position so as not to interfere with 
either the bowler’s run-up or the striker’s view. 

The striker’s end umpire may elect to stand on the off side instead of the on side of the pitch, provided he informs the 
captain of the fielding side, the striker and the other umpire. 

2.10  Umpires changing ends 

The umpires shall change ends after each side has had one completed innings. See clause 13.3 (Completed 
innings). 

2.11  Disagreement and dispute 

Where there is disagreement or dispute about any matter, the umpires together shall make the final decision. See 
also clause 31.6 (Consultation by umpires). 

2.12  Umpire’s decision 

An umpire may alter any decision provided that such alteration is made promptly. This apart, an umpire’s decision, 
once made, is final. 

2.13  Signals 

2.13.1  The following code of signals shall be used by umpires. 

5 

 

2.13.1.1  Signals made while the ball is in play 

No ball - by extending one arm horizontally. 

Out - by raising an index finger above the head. (If not out, the umpire shall call Not out.) 

Wide - by extending both arms horizontally. 

Dead ball - by crossing and re-crossing the wrists below the waist. 

2.13.1.2  When the ball is dead, the bowler’s end umpire shall repeat the signals in clause 2.13.1.1, with the 

exception of the signal for Out, to the scorers. 

2.13.1.3  The signals listed below shall be made to the scorers only when the ball is dead. 

Boundary 4 - by waving an arm from side to side finishing with the arm across the chest 

Boundary 6 - by raising both arms above the head. 

Bye - by raising an open hand above the head. 

Commencement of last hour - by pointing to a raised wrist with the other hand. 

Five Penalty runs awarded to the batting side - by repeated tapping of one shoulder with the 
opposite hand. 

Five Penalty runs awarded to the fielding side - by placing one hand on the opposite shoulder. 

Leg bye - by touching a raised knee with the hand. 

New ball - by holding the ball above the head. 

Revoke last signal - by touching both shoulders, each with the opposite hand. 

Short run - by bending one arm upwards and touching the nearer shoulder with the tips of the 
fingers. 

The following signal is for Level 4 player conduct offences. The signal has two parts, both of which 
should be acknowledged separately by the scorers. 

Level 4 conduct 

Part 1 - by putting one arm out to the side of the body and repeatedly 
raising it and lowering it. 

Part 2 - by raising an index finger, held at shoulder height, to the side of 
the body. 

2.13.1.4  All the signals in clause 2.13.1.3 are to be made by the bowler’s end umpire except that for Short run, 

which is to be signalled by the umpire at the end where short running occurs. However, the bowler’s end 
umpire shall be responsible both for the final signal of Short run to the scorers and, if more than one run is 
short, for informing them as to the number of runs to be recorded. 

2.13.2  The umpire shall wait until each signal to the scorers has been separately acknowledged by a scorer before 

allowing play to proceed. 

If several signals are to be used, they should be given in the order that the events occurred. 

2.14 

Informing the umpires 

Wherever the umpires are to receive information from captains or other players under these Playing Conditions, it will 
be sufficient for one umpire to be so informed and for him/her to inform the other umpire. 

2.15  Correctness of scores 

Consultation between umpires and scorers on doubtful points is essential. The umpires shall, throughout the match, 
satisfy themselves as to the correctness of the number of runs scored, the wickets that have fallen and, where 
appropriate, the number of overs bowled.  

6 

 

The umpires shall ensure that they are able to contact the scorers at any time during the match and at its conclusion 
to address any issues relating to the correctness of scores. 

3  THE SCORERS 

3.1 

Appointment of scorers 

Two scorers shall be appointed to record all runs scored, all wickets taken and, where appropriate, number of overs 
bowled. 

3.2 

Correctness of scores 

The scorers shall frequently check to ensure that their records agree and consult with the umpires if necessary. See 
clause 2.15 (Correctness of scores). 

3.3 

Acknowledging signals 

The scorers shall accept all instructions and signals given to them by the umpires and shall immediately acknowledge 
each separate signal. 

4  THE BALL 

4.1  Weight and size 

The ball, when new, shall weigh not less than 5.5 ounces/155.9 g, nor more than 5.75 ounces/163 g, and shall 
measure not less than 8.81 in/22.4 cm, nor more than 9 in/22.9 cm in circumference. 

4.2 

Approval and control of balls 

4.2.1 

4.2.2 

4.2.3 

4.2.4 

The Home Board shall provide cricket balls of an approved standard for Test cricket and spare used balls for 
changing during a match, which shall also be of the same brand. Note: The Home Board shall be required to 
advise the Visiting Board of the brand of ball to be used in the match(es) at least 30 days prior to the start of 
the match(es). However, for day-night Test matches, the precise brand, type and colour of ball shall be 
subject to prior approval of the visiting Board. 

The fielding captain or his nominee may select the ball with which he wishes to bowl from the supply 
provided by the Home Board. The fourth umpire shall take a box containing at least 6 new balls to the 
dressing room and supervise the selection of the ball. 

The umpires shall retain possession of the match ball(s) throughout the duration of the match when play is 
not actually taking place. 

During play umpires shall periodically and irregularly inspect the condition of the ball and shall retain 
possession of it at the fall of a wicket, a drinks interval, or any other disruption in play. 

4.3 

New ball 

A new ball shall be used at the start of each innings. 

4.4 

New ball available after 80 overs 

The captain of the fielding side may demand a new ball when the number of overs, excluding any part overs, bowled 
with the old one is equal to or greater than 80 overs. The umpire shall inform the other umpire and indicate to the 
batsmen and the scorers whenever a new ball is taken into play. 

4.5 

Ball lost or becoming unfit for play 

If, during play, the ball cannot be found or recovered or the umpires agree that it has become unfit for play through 
normal use, the umpires shall replace it with a ball which has had wear comparable with that which the previous ball 
had received before the need for its replacement. When the ball is replaced, the umpires shall inform the batsmen 
and the fielding captain. 

7 

 

However, if the ball needs to be replaced after 110 overs for any of the reasons above, it shall be replaced by a new 
ball. If the ball is to be replaced, the umpires shall inform the batsmen, the fielding captain and the scorers. 

5  THE BAT

6  THE PITCH 

6.1 

Area of pitch 

The pitch is a rectangular area of the ground 22 yards/20.12 m in length and 10 ft/3.05 m in width. It is bounded at 
either end by the bowling creases and on either side by imaginary lines, one each side of the imaginary line joining 
the centres of the two middle stumps, each parallel to it and 5 ft/1.52 m from it. If the pitch is next to an artificial pitch 
which is closer than 5 ft/1.52 m from the middle stumps, the pitch on that side will extend only to the junction of the 
two surfaces. See clauses 8.1 (Description, width and pitching) and 7.2 (The bowling crease). 

6.2 

Fitness of pitch for play 

The umpires shall be the sole judges of the fitness of the pitch for play. See clauses 2.7 (Fitness for play), 2.8 
(Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable conditions) and 6.4 (changing the pitch). 

6.3 

Selection and preparation 

Before the match, the Ground Authority shall be responsible for the selection and preparation of the pitch. During the 
match, the umpires shall control its use and maintenance. 

9 

 

6.3.1 

6.3.2 

The Ground Authority shall ensure that during the period prior to the start of play and during intervals, the 
pitch area shall be roped off so as to prevent unauthorised access. (The pitch area shall include an area at 
least 2 metres beyond the rectangle made by the crease markings at both ends of the pitch). 

The fourth umpire shall ensure that, prior to the start of play and during any intervals, only authorised staff, 
the ICC match officials, players, team coaches and authorised television personnel shall be allowed access 
to the pitch area. Such access shall be subject to the following limitations: 

6.3.2.1  Only captains and team coaches may walk on the actual playing surface of the pitch area (outside of the 

crease markings). 

6.3.2.2 

Access to the pitch area by television personnel shall be restricted to one camera crew (including one or 
two television commentators) of the official licensed television broadcaster(s) (but not news crews). 

6.3.2.3 

No spiked footwear shall be permitted. 

6.3.2.4 

No one shall be permitted to bounce a ball on the pitch, strike it with a bat or cause damage to the pitch in 
any other way. 

6.3.2.5 

Access shall not interfere with pitch preparation. 

6.3.3 

In the event of any dispute, the ICC Match Referee will rule and his ruling will be final. 

6.4 

Changing the pitch 

6.4.1 

If the on-field umpires decide that it is dangerous or unreasonable for play to continue on the match pitch, 
they shall stop play and immediately advise the ICC Match Referee. 

6.4.2 

The on-field umpires and the ICC Match Referee shall then consult with both captains. 

6.4.3 

If the captains agree to continue, play shall resume. 

6.4.4 

If the decision is not to resume play, the on-field umpires together with the ICC Match Referee shall consider 
whether the existing pitch can be repaired and the match resumed from the point it was stopped. In 
considering whether to authorise such repairs, the ICC Match Referee must consider whether this would 
place either side at an unfair advantage, given the play that had already taken place on the dangerous pitch. 

6.4.5 

If the decision is that the existing pitch cannot be repaired, then the match is to be abandoned as a draw. 

6.4.6 

6.4.7 

6.4.8 

If the abandonment occurs on the first scheduled day of the match, the ICC Match Referee shall consult with 
the Home Board with the objective of finding a way for a new match (including a new nomination of teams 
and toss) to commence on the same date and venue. Such a match may be played either on the repaired 
pitch or on another pitch, subject to the ICC Match Referee and the relevant Ground Authority both being 
satisfied that the new pitch will be of the required Test standard. The playing time lost between the 
scheduled start time of the original match and the actual start time of the new match will be covered by the 
provisions of clause 12. 

If it is not possible to start a new match on the scheduled first day of the original match, the relevant officials 
from the participating Boards shall agree on whether the match can be replayed within the existing tour 
schedule. 

Throughout the above decision making processes, the ICC Match Referee shall keep informed both 
captains and the head of the Ground Authority. The head of the Ground Authority shall ensure that suitable 
and prompt public announcements are made. 

6.5 

Non-turf pitches 

All Test matches shall be played on natural turf pitches. The use of PVA and other adhesives in the preparation of 
pitches is not permitted.

either side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps and shall be considered to be unlimited 
in length. 

7.4 

The return creases 

The return creases, which are the inside edges of the crease markings, shall be at right angles to the popping crease 
at a distance of 4 ft 4 in/1.32 m either side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps. Each 
return crease shall be marked from the popping crease to a minimum of 8 ft/2.44 m behind it and shall be considered 
to be unlimited in length. 

8  THE WICKETS 

8.1 

Description, width and pitching 

Two sets of wickets shall be pitched opposite and parallel to each other in the centres of the bowling creases. Each 
set shall be 9 in/22.86 cm wide and shall consist of three wooden stumps with two wooden bails on top. See 
paragraph 2 of Appendix B. 

8.2 

Size of stumps 

The tops of the stumps shall be 28 in/71.12 cm above the playing surface and shall be dome shaped except for the 
bail grooves. The portion of a stump above the playing surface shall be cylindrical apart from the domed top, with 
circular section of diameter not less than 1.38 in/3.50 cm nor more than 1.5 in/3.81 cm. See paragraph 2 of Appendix 
B. 

For televised matches the Home Board may provide a slightly larger cylindrical stump to accommodate the stump 
camera. When the larger stump is used, all three stumps must be exactly the same size. 

8.3 

The bails 

8.3.1 

The bails, when in position on top of the stumps, 

- shall not project more than 0.5 in/1.27 cm above them.

Overall length 4.31 in/10.95 cm 

Length of barrel 2.13 in /5.40 cm 

Longer spigot 1.38 in/3.50 cm 

Shorter spigot 0.81 in/2.06 cm. 

8.3.3 

The two spigots and the barrel shall have the same centre line. 

11 

 

8.3.4 

Devices aimed at protecting player safety by limiting the distance that a bail can travel off the stumps will be 
allowed, subject to the approval of the Home Board and the ICC. 

8.4 

Dispensing with bails 

The umpires may agree to dispense with the use of bails, if necessary. If they so agree then no bails shall be used at 
either end. The use of bails shall be resumed as soon as conditions permit. See clause 29.4 (Dispensing with bails). 

8.5 

LED Wickets 

The use of approved LED Wickets is permitted. Refer also to paragraphs 3.8.1.6 and 4.2 of Appendix D. 

9  PREPARATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE PLAYING 

AREA 

9.1 

Rolling 

The pitch shall not be rolled during the match except as permitted in clauses 9.1.1 and 9.1.2. 

9.1.1 

Frequency and duration of rolling 

During the match the pitch may be rolled at the request of the captain of the batting side, for a period of not 
more than 7 minutes, before the start of each innings, other than the first innings of the match, and before 
the start of each subsequent day’s play. See clause 9.1.4. 

9.1.2 

Rolling after a delayed start 

In addition to the rolling permitted above, if, after the toss and before the first innings of the match, the start 
is delayed, the captain of the batting side may request that the pitch be rolled for not more than 7 minutes. 
However, if the umpires together agree that the delay has had no significant effect on the state of the pitch, 
they shall refuse such request for rolling of the pitch. 

9.1.3 

Choice of rollers 

If there is more than one roller available the captain of the batting side shall choose which one is to be used. 

9.1.4 

Timing of permitted rolling 

The rolling permitted (maximum 7 minutes) before play begins on any day shall be started not more than 30 
minutes before the time scheduled or rescheduled for play to begin. The captain of the batting side may, 
however, delay the start of such rolling until not less than 10 minutes before the time scheduled or 
rescheduled for play to begin. 

The following shall apply in addition to clause 9.1: 

9.1.5 

Prior to the scheduled time for the toss, the artificial drying of the pitch and outfield shall be at the discretion 
of the Ground Authority. Thereafter and throughout the match the drying of the outfield may be undertaken 
at any time by the Ground Authority, but the drying of the affected area of the pitch shall be carried out only 
on the instructions and under the supervision of the umpires. The umpires shall be empowered to have the 
pitch dried without reference to the captains at any time they are of the opinion that it is unfit for play. 

9.1.6 

The umpires may instruct the Ground Authority to use any available equipment, including any roller for the 
purpose of drying the pitch and making it fit for play. 

9.1.7

Clearing debris from the pitch 

9.2.1 

The pitch shall be cleared of any debris 

12 

 

9.2.1.1 

before the start of each day’s play. This shall be after the completion of mowing and before any rolling, not 
earlier than 30 minutes nor later than 10 minutes before the time or any rescheduled time for start of play. 

9.2.1.2 

between innings. This shall precede rolling if any is to take place. 

9.2.1.3 

at all intervals for meals. 

9.2.2 

The clearance of debris in clause 9.2.1 shall be done by sweeping, except where the umpires consider that 
this may be detrimental to the surface of the pitch. In this case the debris must be cleared from that area by 
hand, without sweeping. 

9.2.3 

In addition to clause 9.2.1, debris may be cleared from the pitch by hand, without sweeping, before mowing 
and whenever either umpire considers it necessary.

9.3.1.2 

All subsequent mowings shall be carried out under the supervision of the umpires. 

9.3.2 

The pitch and outfield 

In order that throughout the match the ground conditions should be as nearly the same for both sides as 
possible, both the pitch and the outfield shall be mown on each day of the match on which play is expected 
to take place, if ground and weather conditions permit. 

If, for reasons other than conditions of ground or weather, complete mowing of the outfield is not possible, 
the Ground Authority shall notify the captains and umpires of the procedure to be adopted for such mowing 
during the match. 

9.3.3 

Timing of mowing 

9.3.3.1  Mowing of the pitch on any day shall be completed not later than 30 minutes before the time scheduled or

The pitch shall not be watered during the match. 

9.5 

Re-marking creases 

Creases shall be re-marked whenever either umpire considers it necessary. 

9.6  Maintenance of footholes 

The umpires shall ensure that the holes made by the bowlers and batsmen are cleaned out and dried whenever 
necessary to facilitate play. 

The umpires shall allow, if necessary, the returfing of footholes made by the bowlers in their delivery strides, or the 
use of quick-setting fillings for the same purpose. 

In addition, the umpires shall see that wherever possible and whenever it is considered necessary, action is taken 
during all intervals in play to do whatever is practicable to improve the bowler’s footholes. As soon as possible after 
the conclusion of each day’s play, bowler’s footholes will be repaired. 

9.7 

Securing of footholds and maintenance of pitch 

During play, umpires shall allow the players to secure their footholds by the use of sawdust provided that no damage 
to the pitch is caused and that clause 41 (Unfair play) is not contravened. 

13 

 

9.8  Watering the outfield 

The watering of the outfield will be permitted during the match subject to the following: 

9.8.1 

Such watering shall only be possible if the “watering plan” is requested by the Ground Authority and 
approved by the umpires before the match has started. Once the match has started, any such request will 
not be considered. 

9.8.2 

The consent of the captains is not required, but the umpires shall advise both captains and the ICC Match 
Referee before the start of the match on what has been agreed. 

9.8.3 

The watering shall occur as soon as possible after the conclusion of the day’s play. 

9.8.4 

The watering shall only be carried out to the extent that it is necessary to retain the good condition of the

The protection (by way of an appropriate cover) and preparation of pitches which are adjacent to the match pitch will 
be permitted during the match subject to the following: 

9.9.1 

9.9.2 

Such measures will only be possible if requested by the Ground Authority and approved by the umpires 
before the start of the match. 

Approval should only be granted where such measures are unavoidable and will not compromise the safety 
of the players or their ability to execute their actions with complete freedom. 

9.9.3 

The preparation work shall be carried out under the supervision of the fourth umpire. 

9.9.4 

9.9.5 

Any necessary watering shall be carried out only to the extent necessary for such preparations and shall not 
be permitted in circumstances which may in any way affect the match pitch. 

The consent of the captains is not required but the umpires shall advise both captains and the ICC Match 
Referee before the start of the match on what has been agreed. 

10 COVERING THE PITCH 

10.1  Before the match 

The use of covers before the match is the responsibility of the Ground Authority and may include full covering if 
required. 

The pitch shall be entirely protected against rain up to the commencement of play. 

However, the Ground Authority shall grant suitable facility to the captains to inspect the pitch before the nomination of 
their players and to the umpires to discharge their duties as laid down in clauses 2 (The umpires), 6 (The pitch), 7 
(The creases), 8 (The wickets), and 9 (Preparation and maintenance of the playing area). 

10.2  During the match 

The pitch shall be entirely protected against rain up to the commencement of play each day, and for the duration of 
the period of the match. It shall be wholly covered at the termination of each day’s play or providing the weather is 
fine, within a period of two hours thereafter. 

The covers must totally protect the pitch and also the pitch surroundings, to a minimum of 5 metres either side of the 
pitch, and any worn or soft areas in the outfield. 

14 

 

The bowlers’ run-ups shall be covered during inclement weather, in order to keep them dry, to a distance of at least 
10 x 10 metres. 

10.3  Removal of covers 

All covers (including “hessian” or “scrim” covers used to protect the pitch against the sun) shall be removed not later 
than 2 ½ hours before the scheduled start of play provided it is not raining at the time, but the pitch will be covered 
again if rain falls prior to the commencement of play. 

11 INTERVALS 

11.1  An interval 

11.1.1  The following shall be classed as intervals. 

- The period between close of play on one day and the start of the next day’s play. 

- Intervals between innings. 

- Intervals for meals. 

- Intervals for drinks. 

- Any other agreed interval. 

11.1.2  Only these intervals shall be considered as scheduled breaks for the purposes of clause 24.2.6. 

11.2  Duration of intervals 

11.2.1  An interval for lunch or tea shall be of the duration detailed below, taken from the call of Time before the 

interval until the call of Play on resumption after the interval. 

11.2.1.1  Lunch Interval: The interval shall be of 40 minutes duration. 

11.2.1.2  Tea Interval: The interval shall be of 20 minutes duration. 

11.2.1.3  Home Boards, with the consent of the visiting Board, may seek the approval of the ICC to amend the 

duration of these two intervals, provided the combined scheduled duration of the two intervals shall be 
equal to 60 minutes. 

11.2.2  An interval between innings shall be 10 minutes, commencing from the close of an innings until the call of 

Play for the start of the next innings. See, however, clauses 11.4, 11.6 and 11.7. 

11.3  Allowance for interval between innings 

In addition to the provisions of clauses 11.5 and 11.6, 

11.3.1 

11.3.2 

if an innings ends when 10 minutes or less remains before the time agreed for close of play, or when there 
are less than 2 overs remaining to complete the minimum over requirement on any day, whichever is 
applicable, there shall be no further play on that day. No change shall be made to the time for the start of 
play on the following day on account of the 10 minute interval between innings. 

if a captain declares an innings closed during an interruption in play of more than 10 minutes duration, 
provided that at least 10 minutes remains of the interruption, no adjustment shall be made to the time for 
resumption of play on account of the 10 minute interval between innings, which shall be considered as 
included in the interruption. If less than 10 minutes remains of the interruption when the captain declares the 
innings closed, or forfeits an innings, the next innings shall commence 10 minutes after the declaration or 
forfeiture is made. 

11.3.3 

if a captain declares an innings closed during any interval other than an interval for drinks, provided that at 
least 10 minutes remains of the interval, the interval shall be of the agreed duration and shall be considered 
to include the 10 minute interval between innings. If less than 10 minutes remains of the interval when the 

15 

 

captain declares the innings closed, or forfeits an innings, the interval shall be extended as necessary and 
the next innings shall commence 10 minutes after the declaration or forfeiture is made. 

11.4  Changing agreed times of intervals 

If, at any time during the match, 

either 

playing time is lost through adverse conditions of ground, weather or light or in exceptional 
circumstances, 

or 

the players have occasion to leave the field other than at a scheduled interval, 

the time of the lunch interval or of the tea interval may be changed if the two umpires and both captains so agree, 
providing the requirements of clauses 11.2 and 11.5, 11.6,11.7 and 11.8.3 are not contravened. 

11.5  Changing agreed time for lunch interval 

11.5.1 

If an innings ends when 10 minutes or less remains before the agreed time for lunch, the interval shall be 
taken immediately. It shall be of the agreed duration and shall be considered to include the 10 minute 
interval between innings. 

11.5.2 

If because of adverse conditions of ground, weather or light, or in exceptional circumstances, a stoppage 
occurs when 10 minutes or less remains before the agreed time for lunch, then, whether or not agreement is 
reached in the circumstances of clause 11.4, the interval shall be taken immediately. It shall be of the 
agreed duration. Play shall resume at the end of this interval or as soon after as conditions permit. 

11.5.3 

If the players have occasion to leave the field for any reason when more than 10 minutes remains before the 
agreed time for lunch then, unless the umpires and captains together agree to alter it, lunch shall be taken at 
the agreed time. 

11.6  Changing agreed time for tea interval 

11.6.1 

If an innings ends when 30 minutes or less remains before the agreed time for tea, the interval shall be 
taken immediately. It shall be of the agreed duration and shall be considered to include the 10 minute 
interval between innings. 

11.6.2 

If, when 30 minutes remains before the agreed time for tea, an interval between innings is already in 
progress, play shall resume at the end of the 10 minute interval, if conditions permit. 

11.6.3 

If, because of adverse conditions of ground, weather or light, or in exceptional circumstances, a stoppage 
occurs when 30 minutes or less remains before the agreed time for tea, then unless there is an agreement 
to change the time for tea, as permitted in clause 11.4, the interval shall be taken immediately. The interval 
shall be of the agreed duration. Play shall resume at the end of the interval or as soon after as conditions 
permit. 

11.6.4 

If a stoppage is already in progress when 30 minutes remains before the agreed time for tea, clause 11.4 
shall apply. 

11.7  Lunch or tea interval – 9 wickets down 

For the lunch interval and for the tea interval 

If 

either, 9 wickets are already down when 3 minutes remains to the scheduled time for the interval, 

or, the 9th wicket falls within this 3 minutes, or at any time up to and including the final ball of the over in 
progress at the scheduled time for the interval, 

then the provisions of clause 12.5.2 shall not apply and the interval will not be taken until the end of the over that is in 
progress 30 minutes after the originally agreed time for the interval, unless the players have cause to leave the field 
of play or the innings is completed earlier. 

For the purposes of this section of the Playing Conditions, the retirement of a batsman is not to be considered 
equivalent to the fall of a wicket. 

16 

 

11.8 

Intervals for drinks 

11.8.1  Drinks intervals shall be scheduled. Each interval shall be kept as short as possible and in any case shall 

not exceed 4 minutes. 

11.8.1.1  There shall be one drinks interval during each session of play, scheduled at the mid-point of the session. 

11.8.1.2  Under conditions of extreme heat the umpires may permit extra intervals for drinks during each session. 

11.8.1.3  An individual player may be given a drink either on the boundary edge or at the fall of a wicket, on the field, 

provided that no playing time is wasted. No other drinks shall be taken onto the field without the 
permission of the umpires. Any player taking drinks onto the field shall be dressed in proper cricket attire 
(subject to the wearing of bibs – refer to the note in clause 24.1.4). 

11.8.2  A drinks interval shall be taken at the end of the over in progress when the agreed time is reached. If, 

however, a wicket falls or a batsman retires within 5 minutes of the agreed time then drinks shall be taken 
immediately. 

No other variation in the timing of drinks intervals shall be permitted except as provided for in clause 11.8.3. 

11.8.3 

If an innings ends or the players have to leave the field of play for any other reason within 30 minutes of the 
agreed time for a drinks interval, the umpires and captains together may rearrange the timing of drinks 
intervals in that session. 

11.8.4 

Intervals for drinks may not be taken during the last hour of the match, as defined in clause 12.6 (Last hour 
of match – number of overs). Subject to this limitation, the captains and umpires shall agree the times for 
such intervals, if any, before the toss and on each subsequent day not later than 10 minutes before play is 
scheduled to start. 

11.9  Agreement to forgo intervals 

At any time during the match, the captains may agree to forgo any of the drinks intervals. The umpires shall be 
informed of the decision. 

When play is in progress, the batsmen at the wicket may deputise for their captain in making an agreement to forgo a 
drinks interval in that session. 

11.10  Scorers to be informed 

The umpires shall ensure that the scorers are informed of all agreements about hours of play and intervals and of any 
changes made thereto as permitted under this clause. 

12 START OF PLAY; CESSATION OF PLAY 

12.1  Call of Play 

The bowler’s end umpire shall call Play before the first ball of the match and on the resumption of play after any 
interval or interruption. 

12.2  Call of Time 

The bowler’s end umpire shall call Time, when the ball is dead, at the end of any session of play or as required by 
these Playing Conditions. See also clause 20.3 (Call of Over or Time). 

12.3  Removal of bails 

After the call of Time, the bails shall be removed from both wickets. 

12.4  Starting a new over 

Another over shall always be started at any time during the match, unless an interval is to be taken in the 
circumstances set out in clause 12.5.2, if the umpire, walking at normal pace, has arrived at the position behind the 
stumps at the bowler’s end before the time agreed for the next interval, or for the close of play, has been reached. 

17 

 

12.5  Completion of an over 

Other than at the end of the match, 

12.5.1 

if the agreed time for an interval is reached during an over, the over shall be completed before the interval is 
taken, except as provided for in clause 12.5.2. 

12.5.2  when less than 3 minutes remains before the time agreed for the next interval, the interval shall be taken 

immediately if: 

either a batsman is dismissed or retires; or 

 

the players have occasion to leave the field, 

whether this occurs during an over or at the end of an over. Except at the end of an innings, if an over is 
thus interrupted it shall be completed on the resumption of play. 

12.6  Conclusion of match 

12.6.1  The match is concluded 

12.6.1.1  as soon as a result as defined in clauses 16.1 to 16.5 (The result) is reached. 

12.6.1.2  as soon as both 

the minimum number of overs for the last hour are completed 

and the agreed time for close of play is reached, 

unless a result is reached earlier. 

12.6.2  The match is concluded if, without a conclusion having been reached under 12.6.1, the players leave the 

field for adverse conditions of ground, weather or light, or in exceptional circumstances, and no further play 
is possible. 

12.7  Hours of Play; Minimum Overs Requirement 

The Home Board shall determine the hours of play, subject to there being 6 hours scheduled play per day, and 
subject to: 

12.7.1  Minimum Overs in the Day 

Subject to clause 12.7.2 below: 

12.7.1.1  On days other than the last day, play shall continue on each day until the completion of a minimum target 

of 90 overs (or a minimum of 15 overs per hour) or the completion of the scheduled or rescheduled 
cessation time, whichever is the later but provided that play shall not continue for more than 30 minutes 
beyond the scheduled or rescheduled cessation time (permitted overtime). For the sake of clarity, if any of 
the minimum target number of overs have not been bowled at the completion of the permitted overtime, 
play shall cease upon completion of the over in progress. The overs not bowled shall not be made up on 
any subsequent day. 

12.7.1.2  On the last day, a minimum of 75 overs (or a minimum of 15 overs per hour) shall be bowled during the 

playing time other than the last hour of the match where clause 12.7.6 below shall apply. If any of the 
minimum of 75 overs, or as recalculated, have not been bowled when one hour of the scheduled playing 
time remains, the last hour of the match for the purposes of clause 12.7.6 shall be the hour immediately 
following the completion of these overs. 

12.7.2  Reduction in minimum overs 

Except in the last hour of the match, for which clause 12.7.6 makes provision, if play is suspended due to 
adverse weather or light or any other reason (other than normal intervals) for more than 1 hour on any day, 
the minimum number of overs shall be reduced by 1 over for each full 4 minutes of the aggregate playing 
time lost. For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate of 1 hour shall be inclusive of any time that may have 

18 

 

been brought forward from previous days due to playing time lost on such previous days under clause 
12.7.3.2 below. 

12.7.3  Making Up Lost Time 

12.7.3.1  On The Day 

Subject to weather and light, except in the last hour of the match, in the event of play being 
suspended for any reason other than normal intervals, the playing time on that day shall be 
extended by the amount of time lost up to a maximum of 1 hour. For the avoidance of doubt, the 
maximum of 1 hour shall be inclusive of any time that may have been added to the scheduled 
playing time due to playing time having been lost on previous days under clause 12.7.3.2 below. 

12.7.3.2  On Subsequent Days 

If any time is lost and cannot be made up under clause 12.7.3.1 above, additional time of up to a 
maximum of 30 minutes per day shall be added to the scheduled playing hours for the next day, 
and subsequent day(s) as required (to make up as much lost time as possible). Where 
appropriate this additional time shall be added prior to the scheduled start of the first session. In 
circumstances where it is not possible to add this additional time prior to the scheduled start of 
the first session, the additional time may be added to the second and/or the third sessions (see 
also clause 12.7.4). When such additional time is added, the minimum overs for that day shall be 
increased by one over for each four minutes of additional time or part thereof. 

12.7.3.3  On the Last Day only (refer to Appendix E) 

Clause 12.7.3.1 applies. However, for the purposes of this clause, the definition of playing time 
shall exclude the last hour. No time is made up in respect of any interruptions that commence 
after the start of the last hour. 

Should play be interrupted prior to the last hour being signalled, the playing time lost will be 
made up (subject to the maximum of 1 hour described in (a) above) with the previously 
scheduled time for the last hour being updated to reflect the time made up during this 
interruption. 

In order to determine the minimum overs to be bowled prior to the last hour and the rescheduled 
starting time for the last hour, it is necessary to complete the template in Appendix E. 

12.7.3.4     For Day/Night Test matches, the participating teams may agree on the following: 

- 
- 

The maximum amount of make-up time to be used on the day up to no more than 1 hour; 
The maximum make-up time to be added to subsequent days up to no more than 30 minutes 
per day; and 

-  When the make-up time is to be allocated across subsequent days. 

12.7.4  Change of Intervals 

12.7.4.1 

If play has been suspended for any reason other than normal intervals for 30 minutes or more prior to the 
commencement of the scheduled or rescheduled tea interval on that day, the tea interval shall be delayed 
for 30 minutes. 

12.7.4.2  Notwithstanding the provisions of clause 12.7.4.1above, the timings of intervals can be altered under 

clause 11.4 at any time on any day if playing time has been lost irrespective of whether the time has been 
lost on that day or on any previous days. 

12.7.5  Change of Innings 

Where there is a change of innings during a day’s play (except where the change of innings occurs at lunch or tea or 
when play is suspended for any reason) 2 overs will be deducted from the minimum number of overs to be bowled. 

The over in progress at the end of an innings is regarded as a completed over for the purposes of determining the 
minimum number of remaining overs to be bowled in the day, except when the change of innings occurs in the last 
hour of the match (see clause 12.12.3). 

19 

 

12.7.6  Last Hour 

A minimum of 15 overs shall be bowled in the last hour and all calculations with regard to suspensions of 
play or the start of a new innings shall be based on 1 over for each full 4 minutes (refer to clause 12.7.9 
below). 

On the final day, if both captains (the batsmen at the wicket may act for their captain) accept that there is no 
prospect of either side achieving a victory, they may agree to finish the match after (a) the time for the 
commencement of the last hour has been reached OR (b) there are a minimum of 15 overs to be bowled, 
whichever is the later. 

12.7.7  Notwithstanding any other provision, there shall be no further play on any day, other than the last day, if a 
wicket falls or a batsman retires or if the players have occasion to leave the field during the last minimum 
over within 3 minutes of the scheduled cessation time or thereafter. This shall also apply to the additional 
time permitted in order to complete the minimum over requirement for the day. If an over is interrupted in 
these circumstances stumps shall be drawn for the day and the over shall be completed on the resumption 
of play. 

12.7.8  An over completed on resumption of a new day’s play shall be disregarded in calculating minimum overs for 

that day. 

12.7.9  Stumps Drawn 

Except on the final day: 

12.7.9.1 

In the event of play being suspended for any reason at or after the most recently scheduled or rescheduled 
cessation time, stumps shall be drawn upon play being suspended. 

12.7.9.2 

In the event of the players already being off the field for a suspension of play at the most recently 
rescheduled cessation time, then stumps will be drawn at that time. 

12.7.10  The scoreboard shall show: 

12.7.10.1  the total number of overs bowled with the ball currently in use: and 

12.7.10.2  the minimum number of overs remaining to be bowled in a day. 

12.7.11  Penalties shall apply for slow over rates (refer to the ICC Code of Conduct and see clause 12.9 below). 

12.7.12  Day-Night Tests 

Home Boards may, prior to the commencement of a Test, and with the agreement of the Visiting Board, 
seek the approval of the ICC to play the match as a day/night Test. In such a case the hours of play shall be 
determined by agreement between the Home Board and the Visiting Board subject to there being 6 hours 
scheduled play per day. 

12.8  Extra Time 

12.8.1  At the End of the Day 

The umpires may decide to play 30 minutes (a minimum of 8 overs) extra time at the end of any day (other 
than the last day) if requested by either captain if, in the umpires opinion, it would bring about a definite 
result on that day. This is in addition to the additional time provided for in clause 12.7.3 above. If the umpires 
do not believe a result can be achieved no extra time shall be allowed. 

If it is decided to play such extra time on one or more of these days, the whole period shall be played out 
even though the possibility of finishing the match may have disappeared before the full period has expired. 

Only the actual amount of playing time up to the maximum 30 minutes extra time by which play is extended 
on any day shall be deducted from the total number of hours of play remaining, and the match shall end 
earlier on the final day by the amount of time by which play was previously extended under this clause. 

12.8.2  At the Lunch or Tea Interval 

20 

 

The umpires may decide to extend play by 15 minutes (a minimum of four overs) at the scheduled lunch or 
tea interval of any day if requested by either captain if, in the umpires’ opinion, it would bring about a definite 
result in that session. If the umpires do not believe a result can be achieved no extra time shall be allowed. 

If it is decided to extend play, the whole period shall be played out even though the possibility of finishing the 
match may have disappeared before the full period has expired. 

The following session of play shall be reduced by the amount of time by which play was previously extended 
under this clause. 

12.8.3  For the avoidance of doubt, clause 11.7 shall still apply subsequent to the application of this clause, i.e when 

9 wickets are down following the extra 15 minutes. However, this clause shall not apply when clause 11.7 
has already been applied, i.e. the 15 minutes shall not be added at the end of 30 minutes extra time. 

12.9  Minimum Over Rates 

The minimum over rate to be achieved in Test Matches shall be 15 overs per hour. 

The actual over rate shall be calculated at the end of the match by the umpires and shall be the average rate which is 
achieved by the fielding team across both of the batting team’s innings. 

In calculating the actual over rate for the match, allowances will be given as follows: 

12.9.1  The time lost as a result of treatment given to a player by an authorised medical personnel on the field of 

play; 

12.9.2  The time lost as a result of a player being required to leave the field as a result of a serious injury; 

12.9.3  The time taken for all third umpire referrals and consultations and any umpire or player reviews; 

12.9.4  The time lost as a result of time wasting by the batting side; and 

12.9.5  The time lost due to all other circumstances that are beyond the control of the fielding side. 

12.9.6  2 minutes per wicket taken, provided that such wicket results in the subsequent batsmen immediately 

commencing his innings. For the avoidance of any doubt, no time allowance will be given for the final wicket 
of an innings or where a wicket falls immediately prior to any interval; 

12.9.7  4 minutes per drinks break taken (one per session). 

In the event of any time allowances being granted to the fielding team under clause 12.9.4 above (time wasting by 
batting team), then such time shall be deducted from the allowances granted to such batting team in the 
determination of its over rate. 

If a batting team is bowled out in 3 ½ hours or less (taking into account all of the time allowances set out above) in 
any particular innings, and the fielding team was unable to maintain the minimum over requirement during that 
innings, no account will be taken of the actual over rate in that innings when calculating the actual over rate at the 
end of the match. 

The current over rate of the fielding team (+/- overs compared to the minimum rate required), to be advised by the 
third umpire every 30 minutes as a minimum, shall be displayed on a scoreboard or replay screen. 

12.10  Last hour of match – number of overs 

The bowler’s end umpire shall indicate the commencement of this 15 overs to the players and to the scorers. The 
period of play thereafter shall be referred to as the last hour, whatever its actual duration. 

During an uninterrupted last hour, play will continue until the end of the over in progress when 60 minutes have been 
played, or until 15 overs have been bowled, whichever is later. 

12.11  Last hour of match – interruptions of play 

If there is an interruption in play during the last hour of the match, the minimum number of overs to be bowled shall 
be reduced from 15 as follows: 

21 

 

12.11.1  The time lost for an interruption is counted from the call of Time until the time for resumption as decided by 

the umpires. 

12.11.2  One over shall be deducted for every complete 4 minutes of time lost. 

12.11.3  In the case of more than one such interruption, the minutes lost shall not be aggregated; the calculation shall 

be made for each interruption separately. 

12.11.4  If, when one hour of Playing time remains, an interruption is already in progress 

12.11.4.1  only the time lost after this moment shall be counted in the calculation. 

12.11.4.2  the over in progress at the start of the interruption shall be completed on resumption and shall not count as 

one of the minimum number of overs to be bowled. 

12.11.5  If, after the start of the last hour, an interruption occurs during an over, the over shall be completed on 

resumption of play. The two part-overs shall between them count as one over of the minimum number to be 
bowled. 

12.12  Last hour of match – intervals between innings 

If an innings ends so that a new innings is to be started during the last hour of the match, the interval starts with the 
end of the innings and is to end 10 minutes later. 

12.12.1  If this interval is already in progress at the start of the last hour then, to determine the number of overs to be 

bowled in the new innings, calculations are to be made as set out in clause 12.11. 

12.12.2  If the innings ends after the last hour has started, two calculations are to be made, as set out in clauses 
12.12.3 and 12.12.4. The greater of the numbers yielded by these two calculations is to be the minimum 
number of overs to be bowled in the new innings. 

12.12.3  Calculation based on overs remaining: 

- At the conclusion of the innings, the number of overs that remain to be bowled, of the minimum in the last 
hour, to be noted. 

- If this is not a whole number it is to be rounded up to the next whole number. 

- Two overs, for the interval, to be deducted from the resulting number to determine the number of overs still 
to be bowled. 

12.12.4  Calculation based on time remaining: 

- At the conclusion of the innings, the time remaining until the agreed time for close of play to be noted. 

- 10 minutes, for the interval, to be deducted from this time to determine the Playing time remaining. 

- A calculation to be made of one over for every complete 4 minutes of the Playing time remaining, plus one 
more over if a further part of 4 minutes remains. 

12.13  Completion of last over of match 

The over in progress at the close of play on the final day shall be completed unless 

either a result has been reached; or 

 
circumstances of clause 16.7 (Mistakes in scoring) and the match shall be at an end. 

the players have occasion to leave the field. In this case there shall be no resumption of play except in the 

12.14  Bowler unable to complete an over during last hour of match 

If, for any reason, a bowler is unable to complete an over during the last hour, clause 17.8 (Bowler incapacitated or 
suspended during an over) shall apply. The separate parts of such an over shall count as one over of the minimum to 
be bowled. 

22

over). 

15 DECLARATION AND FORFEITURE

16.2.1.1  concedes defeat or 

16.2.1.2 

in the opinion of the ICC Match Referee refuses to play and the ICC Match Referee shall award the match 
to the other side. 

16.2.2 

If an umpire considers that an action by any player or players might constitute a refusal by either side to play 
then the umpires together shall inform the ICC Match Referee of this fact. The ICC Match Referee shall 
together with the umpires ascertain the cause of the action. If the ICC Match Referee, after due consultation 
with the umpires, then decides that this action does constitute a refusal to play by one side, he/she shall so 
inform the captain of that side. If the captain persists in the action the ICC Match Referee shall award the 
match in accordance with clause 16.2.1.2 above. 

16.2.3 

If action as in clause 16.2.2 above takes place after play has started and does not constitute a refusal to

24 

 

16.2.3.1  Playing time lost shall be counted from the start of the action until play recommences, subject to clause 

11.4 (Changing agreed times for intervals).

16.3  All other matches – A Tie or Draw 

16.3.1  A Tie 

The result of a match shall be a Tie when all innings have been completed and the scores are equal. 

16.3.2  A Draw 

The result of a match shall be a Draw when it is not determined in any of the ways stated in clauses 16.1, 
16.2 or 16.3.1. 

16.4  Winning hit or extras 

16.4.1  As soon as a result is reached as defined in clauses 16.1, 16.2 or 16.3.1, the match is at an end. Nothing 

that happens thereafter, except as in clause 41.18.2 (Penalty runs), shall be regarded as part of it. Note also 
clause 16.7. 

16.4.2  The side batting last will have scored enough runs to win only if its total of runs is sufficient without including 

any runs completed by the batsmen before the completion of a catch, or the obstruction of a catch, from 
which the striker could be dismissed. 

16.4.3 

If a boundary is scored before the batsmen have completed sufficient runs to win the match, the whole of the 
boundary allowance shall be credited to the side’s total and, in the case of a hit by the bat, to the striker’s 
score. 

16.5  Statement of result 

If the side batting last wins the match without losing all its wickets, the result shall be stated as a win by the number of 
wickets still then to fall. 

If, without having scored a total of runs in excess of the total scored by the opposing side, the side batting last has 
lost all its wickets, but as the result of an award of 5 Penalty runs its total of runs is then sufficient to win, the result 
shall be stated as a win to that side by Penalty runs. 

If the side fielding last wins the match, the result shall be stated as a win by runs. 

If the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as Match 
Conceded or Match Awarded, as the case may be. 

16.6  Correctness of result 

Any decision as to the correctness of the scores shall be the responsibility of the umpires. See clause 2.15 
(Correctness of scores). 

16.7  Mistakes in scoring 

If, after the players and umpires have left the field in the belief that the match has been concluded, the umpires 
discover that a mistake in scoring has occurred which affects the result then, subject to clause 16.8, they shall adopt 
the following procedure. 

16.7.1 

If, when the players leave the field, the side batting last has not completed its innings and: 

25 

 

either the number of overs to be bowled in the last hour, or in that innings, has not been completed; 
or 

the agreed time for close of play, or for the end of the innings, has not been reached, 

then, unless one side concedes defeat, the umpires shall order play to resume. 

Unless a result is reached sooner, play will then continue, if conditions permit, until the prescribed number of 
overs has been completed and either time for close of play has been reached or the allotted time for the 
innings has expired, as appropriate. The number of overs and time remaining shall be taken as they were at 
the call of Time for the supposed conclusion of the match. No account shall be taken of the time between 
that moment and the resumption of play. 

16.7.2 

If, at this call of Time, the overs have been completed and no Playing time remains, or if the side batting last 
has completed its innings, the umpires shall immediately inform both captains of the necessary corrections 
to the scores and to the result. 

16.8  Result not to be changed 

Once the umpires have agreed with the scorers the correctness of the scores at the conclusion of the match – see 
clauses 2.15 (Correctness of scores) and 3.2 (Correctness of scores) – the result cannot thereafter be changed. 

17 THE OVER 

17.1  Number of balls 

The ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls. 

17.2  Start of an over 

An over has started when the bowler starts his run-up or, if there is no run-up, starts his action for the first delivery of 
that over. 

17.3  Validity of balls 

17.3.1  A ball shall not count as one of the 6 balls of the over unless it is delivered, even though, as in clause 41.16 

(Non-striker leaving his ground early) a batsman may be dismissed or some other incident occurs without 
the ball having been delivered. 

17.3.2  A ball delivered by the bowler shall not count as one of the 6 balls of the over 

17.3.2.1 

if it is called dead, or is to be considered dead, before the striker has had an opportunity to play it. See 
clause 20.6 (Dead ball; ball counting as one of over). 

17.3.2.2 

if it is called dead in the circumstances of clause 20.4.2.6. Note also the special provisions of clause 
20.4.2.5 (Umpire calling and signaling Dead ball). 

17.3.2.3 

if it is a No ball. See clause 21 (No ball). 

17.3.2.4 

if it is a Wide. See clause 22 (Wide ball). 

17.3.2.5  when any of clauses 24.4 (Player returning without permission), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 41.4 (Deliberate 

attempt to distract striker), or 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batsman) is applied. 

17.3.3  Any deliveries other than those listed in clauses 17.3.1 and 17.3.2 shall be known as valid balls. Only valid 

balls shall count towards the 6 balls of the over. 

17.4  Call of Over 

When 6 valid balls have been bowled and when the ball becomes dead, the umpire shall call Over before leaving the 
wicket. See also clause 20.3 (Call of Over or Time). 

26 

 

17.5  Umpire miscounting 

17.5.1 

If the umpire miscounts the number of valid balls, the over as counted by the umpire shall stand. 

17.5.2 

If, having miscounted, the umpire allows an over to continue after 6 valid balls have been bowled, he/she 
may subsequently call Over when the ball becomes dead after any delivery, even if that delivery is not a 
valid ball. 

17.5.3  Whenever possible, the third umpire shall liaise with the scorers and if possible inform the on-field umpires if 

the over has been miscounted. 

17.6  Bowler changing ends

interruption, it shall be completed on resumption of play. 

17.8  Bowler incapacitated or suspended during an over 

If for any reason a bowler is incapacitated while running up to deliver the first ball of an over, or is incapacitated or 
suspended during an over, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball. Another bowler shall complete the over from 
the same end, provided that he does not bowl two overs consecutively, nor bowl parts of each of two consecutive 
overs, in that innings. 

18 SCORING RUNS 

18.1  A run 

The score shall be reckoned by runs. A run is scored 

18.1.1  so often as the batsmen, at any time while the ball is in play, have crossed and made good their ground from 

end to end. 

18.1.2  when a boundary is scored. See clause 19 (Boundaries). 

18.1.3  when Penalty runs are awarded. See clause 18.6. 

18.2  Runs disallowed 

Wherever in these Playing Conditions provision is made for the scoring of runs or awarding of penalties, such runs

except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side). 

18.3  Short runs 

18.3.1  A run is short if a batsman fails to make good his ground in turning for a further run. 

18.3.2  Although a short run shortens the succeeding one, the latter if completed shall not be regarded as short. A 

striker setting off for the first run from in front of the popping crease may do so also without penalty. 

18.4  Unintentional short runs 

Except in the circumstances of clause 18.5, 

27 

 

18.4.1 

if either batsman runs a short run, the umpire concerned shall, unless a boundary is scored, call and signal 
Short run as soon as the ball becomes dead and that run shall not be scored. 

18.4.2 

if, after either or both batsmen run short, a boundary is scored the umpire concerned shall disregard the 
short running and shall not call or signal Short run. 

18.4.3 

if both batsmen run short in one and the same run, this shall be regarded as only one short run. 

18.4.4 

if more than one run is short then, subject to clauses 18.4.2 and 18.4.3, all runs called as short shall not be 
scored. 

18.4.5 

if there has been more than one short run, the umpire shall inform the scorers as to the number of runs to be 
recorded. 

18.5  Deliberate short runs 

18.5.1 

If either umpire considers that one or both batsmen deliberately ran short at that umpire’s end, the umpire 
concerned shall, when the ball is dead, call and signal Short run and inform the other umpire of what has 
occurred and apply clause 18.5.2. 

18.5.2  The bowler’s end umpire shall 

- disallow all runs to the batting side; 

- return any not out batsman to his original end; 

- signal No ball or Wide to the scorers, if applicable; 

- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side; 

- award any other 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective 
helmets belonging to the fielding side); 

- inform the scorers as to the number of runs to be recorded; and 

- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the 
reason for this action. 

18.6  Runs awarded for penalties 

Runs shall be awarded for penalties under clause 18.5 (Deliberate short runs), 24.4 (Player returning without 
permission), 26.4 (Penalties for contravention), 21 (No ball), 22 (Wide ball), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 28.3 (Protective

fielding side) and 34 (Hit the ball twice) 

18.7  Runs scored for boundaries 

Runs shall be scored for boundary allowances under clause 19 (Boundaries). 

18.8  Runs scored when a batsman is dismissed 

When a batsman is dismissed, any runs for penalties awarded to either side shall stand. 

No other runs shall be credited to the batting side, except as follows. 

18.8.1 

If a batsman is dismissed Obstructing the field, the batting side shall also score any runs completed before 
the offence. 

If, however, the obstruction prevented a catch being made, no runs other than penalties shall be scored. 

18.8.2 

If a batsman is dismissed Run out, the batting side shall also score any runs completed before the wicket 
was put down: 

28 

 

18.9  Runs scored when the ball becomes dead other than at the fall of a wicket 

When the ball becomes dead for any reason other than the fall of a wicket, or is called dead by an umpire, unless 
there is specific provision otherwise in these Playing Conditions, any runs for penalties awarded to either side shall 
be scored. Note however the provisions of clauses 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded) and 28.3 (Protective helmets 
belonging to the fielding side). 

Additionally the batting side shall be credited with all runs completed by the batsmen before the incident or call of 
Dead ball and the run in progress if the batsmen had already crossed at the instant of the incident or call of Dead ball. 
Note specifically, however, the provisions of clause 41.5.8 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of 
batsman). 

18.10  Crediting of runs scored 

Unless stated otherwise in these Playing Conditions, 

18.10.1  if the ball is struck by the bat, all runs scored by the batting side shall be credited to the striker, except for 

the following: 

- an award of 5 Penalty runs, which shall be scored as Penalty runs 

- the one run penalty for a No ball, which shall be scored as a No ball extra. 

18.10.2  if the ball is not struck by the bat, runs shall be scored as Penalty runs, Byes, Leg byes, No ball extras or 

Wides as the case may be. If Byes or Leg byes accrue from a No ball, only the one run penalty for No ball 
shall be scored as such, and the remainder as Byes or Leg byes as appropriate. 

18.10.3  the bowler shall be debited with: 

- all runs scored by the striker 

- all runs scored as No ball extras 

- all runs scored as Wides. 

18.11  Batsman returning to original end 

18.11.1  When the striker is dismissed in any of the circumstances in clauses 18.11.1.1 to 18.11.1.5, the not out 

batsman shall return to his original end. 

18.11.1.1  Bowled. 

18.11.1.2  Stumped. 

18.11.1.3  Hit the ball twice.

18.11.2.2  Runs are disallowed for any reason. 

18.11.2.3  A decision by the batsmen at the wicket to do so, under clause 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or 

obstruction of batsman). 

18.12  Batsman returning to wicket he has left 

18.12.1  When a batsman is dismissed in any of the ways in clauses 18.12.1.1 to 18.12.1.3, the not out batsman 
shall return to the wicket he has left but only if the batsmen had not already crossed at the instant of the 
incident causing the dismissal. If runs are to be disallowed, however, the not out batsman shall return to his 
original end. 

29 

 

18.12.1.1  Caught 

18.12.1.2  Obstructing the field 

18.12.1.3  Run out. 

18.12.2  If, while a run is in progress, the ball becomes dead for any reason other than the dismissal of a batsman, 

the batsmen shall return to the wickets they had left, but only if they had not already crossed in running 
when the ball became dead. If, however, any of the circumstances of clauses 18.11.2.1 to 18.11.2.3 apply, 
the batsmen shall return to their original ends. 

19 BOUNDARIES 

19.1  Determining the boundary of the field of play 

19.1.1  Before the toss, the umpires shall determine the boundary of the field of play, which shall be fixed for the 

duration of the match. See clause 2.3.4 (Consultation with Home Board). 

19.1.2  The boundary shall be determined such that no part of any sight-screen, will, at any stage of the match, be 

within the field of play. 

19.1.3  The aim shall be to maximize the size of the playing area at each venue. With respect to the size of the 

boundaries, no boundary shall be longer than 90 yards (82.29 meters), and no boundary should be shorter 
than 65 yards (59.43 metres) from the centre of the pitch to be used. 

19.1.4  Any ground which has previously been approved to host international cricket which is unable to conform to 

the minimum boundary dimension shall be exempt. In such cases the boundary shall be positioned so as to 
maximize the size of the playing area. 

19.2 

Identifying and marking the boundary 

19.2.1  All boundaries must be designated by a rope, or similar object of a minimum standard as authorised by the 
ICC from time to time. The rope should be positioned a required minimum distance (3 yards (2.74 metres) 
minimum) inside the perimeter fencing or advertising signs, or from any solid object located between the 
rope and the fence/signs. For grounds with a large playing area, the maximum length of boundary should be 
used before applying the minimum 3 yards (2.74 metres) between the boundary and the fence. 

19.2.2 

If the boundary is marked by means of an object that is in contact with the ground the boundary will be the 
edge of the grounded part of the object which is nearest the pitch. 

19.2.3  An obstacle within the field of play shall not be regarded as a boundary unless so determined by the umpires 

before the toss. See clause 2.3.4 (Consultation with Home Board). 

19.2.4 

If an unauthorized person enters the playing arena and handles the ball, the umpire at the bowler’s end shall 
be the sole judge of whether the boundary allowance should be scored or the ball be treated as still in play 
or called dead ball if a batsman is liable to be out as a result of the unauthorized person handling the ball. 

19.3  Restoring the boundary 

If a solid object used to mark the boundary is disturbed for any reason, then: 

19.3.1 

the boundary shall be considered to be in its original position. 

19.3.2 

the object shall be returned to its original position as soon as is practicable; if play is taking place, this shall 
be as soon as the ball is dead. 

19.3.3 

if some part of a fence or other marker has come within the field of play, that part shall be removed from the 
field of play as soon as is practicable; if play is taking place, this shall be as soon as the ball is dead. 

19.4  Ball grounded beyond the boundary 

19.4.1  The ball in play is grounded beyond the boundary if it touches 

30 

 

- the boundary or any part of an object used to mark the boundary; 

- the ground beyond the boundary; 

- any object that is grounded beyond the boundary. 

19.4.2  The ball in play is to be regarded as being grounded beyond the boundary if 

- a fielder, grounded beyond the boundary as in clause 19.5, touches the ball; 

- a fielder, after catching the ball within the boundary, becomes grounded beyond the boundary while in 
contact with the ball, before completing the catch. 

19.5  Fielder grounded beyond the boundary 

19.5.1  A fielder is grounded beyond the boundary if some part of his person is in contact with any of the following: 

- the boundary or any part of an object used to mark the boundary; 

- the ground beyond the boundary; 

- any object that is in contact with the ground beyond the boundary; 

- another fielder who is grounded beyond the boundary. 

19.5.2  A fielder who is not in contact with the ground is considered to be grounded beyond the boundary if his final 

contact with the ground, before his first contact with the ball after it has been delivered by the bowler, was 
not entirely within the boundary. 

19.6  Boundary allowances 

19.6.1  6 runs shall be allowed for a boundary 6; and 4 runs for a boundary 4. See also clause 19.7. 

19.7  Runs scored from boundaries 

19.7.1  A boundary 6 will be scored if and only if the ball has been struck by the bat and is first grounded beyond the 

boundary without having been in contact with the ground within the field of play. This shall apply even if the 
ball has previously touched a fielder. 

19.7.2  A boundary 4 will be scored when a ball that is grounded beyond the boundary 

- whether struck by the bat or not, was first grounded within the boundary, or 

- has not been struck by the bat. 

19.7.3  When a boundary is scored, the batting side, except in the circumstances of clause 19.8, shall be awarded 

whichever is the greater of 

19.7.3.1 

the allowance for the boundary 

19.7.3.2 

the runs completed by the batsmen together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the 
instant the boundary is scored. 

19.7.4  When the runs in clause 19.7.3.2 exceed the boundary allowance they shall replace the boundary allowance 

for the purposes of clause 18.12.2. 

19.7.5  The scoring of Penalty runs by either side is not affected by the scoring of a boundary. 

19.8  Overthrow or wilful act of fielder 

If the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be 

any runs for penalties awarded to either side 

and the allowance for the boundary 

31 

 

and the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the 
instant of the throw or act. 

Clause 18.12.2 (Batsman returning to wicket he has left) shall apply as from the instant of the throw or act. 

20 DEAD BALL

20.1.1  The ball becomes dead when 

20.1.1.1 

it is finally settled in the hands of the wicket-keeper or of the bowler. 

20.1.1.2  a boundary is scored. See clause 19.7 (Runs scored from boundaries). 

20.1.1.3  a batsman is dismissed. The ball will be deemed to be dead from the instant of the incident causing the 

dismissal. 

20.1.1.4  whether played or not it becomes trapped between the bat and person of a batsman or between items of 

his clothing or equipment. 

20.1.1.5  whether played or not it lodges in the clothing or equipment of a batsman or the clothing of an umpire. 

20.1.1.6

20.1.2  The ball shall be considered to be dead when it is clear to the bowler’s end umpire that the fielding side and 

both batsmen at the wicket have ceased to regard it as in play. 

20.1.3 

In a match where cameras are being used on or over the field of play (e.g. Spidercam), should a ball that 
has been hit by the batsman make contact, while still in play, with the camera, its apparatus or its cable, 
either umpire shall call and signal ‘dead ball’. The ball shall not count as one of the over and no runs shall be 
scored. If the delivery was called a No ball it shall count and the No ball penalty shall be applied. No other 
runs (including penalty runs) apart from the No ball penalty shall be scored. 

20.1.4  Should a ball thrown by a fielder make contact with a camera on or over the field of play, its apparatus or its 
cable, either umpire shall call and signal dead ball. Unless this was already a No ball or Wide, the ball shall 
count as one of the over. All runs scored to that point shall count, plus the run in progress if the batsmen 
have already crossed. 

20.1.5  Refer also to paragraph 2.6 of Appendix D. 

20.2  Ball finally settled 

Whether the ball is finally settled or not is a matter for the umpire alone to decide. 

20.3  Call of Over or Time 

Neither the call of Over (see clause 17.4), nor the call of Time (see clause 12.2) is to be made until the ball is dead, 
either under clauses 20.1 or 20.4. 

20.4  Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball 

20.4.1  When the ball has become dead under clause 20.1, the bowler’s end umpire may call and signal Dead ball if

20.4.2.5 

the striker is not ready for the delivery of the ball and, if the ball is delivered, makes no attempt to play it. 
Provided the umpire is satisfied that the striker had adequate reason for not being ready, the ball shall not 
count as one of the over. 

20.4.2.6 

the striker is distracted by any noise or movement or in any other way while preparing to receive, or 
receiving a delivery. This shall apply whether the source of the distraction is within the match or outside it.

20.4.2.7 

there is an instance of a deliberate attempt to distract under either of clauses 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to

20.4.2.11  required to do so under any of the Playing Conditions not included above. 

20.5  Ball ceases to be dead 

The ball ceases to be dead – that is, it comes into play – when the bowler starts his run-up or, if there is no run-up, 
starts his bowling action. 

20.6  Dead ball; ball counting as one of over 

20.6.1  When a ball which has been delivered is called dead or is to be considered dead then, other than as in 

clause 20.6.2, 

20.6.1.1 

it will not count in the over if the striker has not had an opportunity to play it. 

20.6.1.2  unless No ball or Wide ball has been called, it will be a valid ball if the striker has had an opportunity to 
play it, except in the circumstances of clauses 20.4.2.6 and 24.4 (Player returning without permission), 
28.2 (Fielding the ball), 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to distract striker) and 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, 
deception or obstruction of batsman). 

20.6.2 

In clause 20.4.2.5, the ball will not count in the over only if both conditions of not attempting to play the ball 
and having an adequate reason for not being ready are met. Otherwise the delivery will be a valid ball. 

21 NO BALL 

21.1  Mode of delivery 

21.1.1  The umpire shall ascertain whether the bowler intends to bowl right handed or left handed, over or round the 

wicket, and shall so inform the striker. 

It is unfair if the bowler fails to notify the umpire of a change in his mode of delivery. In this case the umpire 
shall call and signal No ball. 

21.1.2  Underarm bowling shall not be permitted. 

21.2  Fair delivery – the arm 

For a delivery to be fair in respect of the arm the ball must not be delivered with an Illegal Bowling Action. 

33 

 

An Illegal Bowling Action is defined as a bowling action where a bowler’s Elbow Extension exceeds 15 degrees, 
measured from the point at which the bowling arm reaches the horizontal until the point at which the ball is released 
(any Elbow Hyperextension shall be discounted for the purposes of determining an Illegal Bowling Action). 

Should either umpire or the ICC Match Referee suspect that a bowler has used an Illegal Bowling Action, they shall 
complete the ICC Bowling Action Report Form at the conclusion of the match, as set out in the Illegal Bowling 
Regulations. 

21.3  Ball thrown or delivered underarm – action by umpires 

21.3.1 

If, in the opinion of either umpire, the ball has been thrown (where such mode of delivery does not 
correspond to the bowler’s normal bowling action) or delivered underarm, he/she shall call and signal No ball 
and, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. 

The bowler’s end umpire shall then 

- warn the bowler, indicating that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall apply to that bowler 
throughout the innings. 

- inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. 

- inform the batsmen at the wicket of what has occurred. 

21.3.2 

If either umpire considers that, in that innings, a further delivery by the same bowler is thrown (where such 
mode of delivery does not correspond to the bowler’s normal bowling action) or delivered underarm, he/she 
shall call and signal No ball and when the ball is dead inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. 

The bowler’s end umpire shall then 

- direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling. The over shall, if 
applicable, be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled the previous over or part thereof 
nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. The bowler thus suspended shall not bowl again in that 
innings. 

- inform the batsmen at the wicket and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the reason 
for this action. 

21.3.3  The umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the ICC Match 

Referee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. 

21.4  Bowler throwing towards striker’s end before delivery 

If the bowler throws the ball towards the striker’s end before entering the delivery stride, either umpire shall call and 
signal No ball. See clause 41.17 (Batsmen stealing a run). 

However, the procedure stated in clause 21.3 of caution, informing, final warning, action against the bowler and 
reporting shall not apply. 

21.5  Fair delivery – the feet 

For a delivery to be fair in respect of the feet, in the delivery stride 

21.5.1 

the bowler’s back foot must land within and not touching the return crease appertaining to his stated mode of 
delivery. 

21.5.2 

the bowler’s front foot must land with some part of the foot, whether grounded or raised 

- on the same side of the imaginary line joining the two middle stumps as the return crease described in 
clause 21.5.1, and 

- behind the popping crease. 

If the bowler’s end umpire is satisfied that any of these three conditions have not been met, he/she shall call and 
signal No ball. See clause 41.8 (Bowling of deliberate front foot No ball). 

34 

 

21.6  Bowler breaking wicket in delivering ball 

Either umpire shall call and signal No ball if, other than in an attempt to run out the non-striker under clause 41.16, 
the bowler breaks the wicket at any time after the ball comes into play and before completion of the stride after the 
delivery stride. This shall include any clothing or other object that falls from his person and breaks the wicket. 

21.7  Ball bouncing more than once, rolling along the ground or pitching off the pitch 

The umpire shall call and signal No ball if a ball which he/she considers to have been delivered, without having 
previously touched bat or person of the striker, 

- bounces more than once or rolls along the ground before it reaches the popping crease. 

- or pitches wholly or partially off the pitch as defined in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch) before it reaches the line of the 
striker’s wicket. 

21.8  Ball coming to rest in front of striker’s wicket 

If a ball delivered by the bowler comes to rest in front of the line of the striker’s wicket, without having previously 
touched the bat or person of the striker, the umpire shall call and signal No ball and immediately call and signal Dead 
ball. 

21.9  Fielder intercepting a delivery 

If, except in the circumstances of clause 27.3 (Position of wicket-keeper) a ball delivered by the bowler, makes 
contact with any part of a fielder’s person before it either makes contact with the striker’s bat or person, or it passes 
the striker’s wicket, the umpire shall call and signal No ball and immediately call and signal Dead ball. 

21.10  Ball bouncing over head height of striker 

See clauses 22.1.1.2, 41.6.4 and 41.6.5. 

21.11  Call of No ball for infringement of other Playing Conditions 

In addition to the instances above, No ball is to be called and signalled as required by the following clauses: 

Clause 27.3 – Position of wicket-keeper 

Clause 28.4 – Limitation of on side fielders 

Clause 28.5 – Fielders not to encroach on pitch 

Clause 41.6 – Bowling of dangerous and unfair short pitched deliveries 

Clause 41.7 – Bowling of dangerous and unfair non-pitching deliveries 

Clause 41.8 – Bowling of deliberate front foot No ball. 

21.12  Revoking a call of No ball 

An umpire shall revoke the call of No ball if Dead ball is called under any of clauses 20.4.2.4 to 20.4.2.9 (Umpire 
calling and signaling Dead ball). 

21.13  No ball to over-ride Wide 

A call of No ball shall over-ride the call of Wide ball at any time. See clauses 22.1 (Judging a Wide) and 22.2 (Call 
and signal of Wide ball). 

21.14  Ball not dead 

The ball does not become dead on the call of No ball. 

35 

 

21.15  Penalty for a No ball 

A penalty of one run shall be awarded instantly on the call of No ball. Unless the call is revoked, the penalty shall 
stand even if a batsman is dismissed. It shall be in addition to any other runs scored, any boundary allowance and 
any other runs awarded for penalties. 

21.16  Runs resulting from a No ball – how scored 

The one run penalty shall be scored as a No ball extra and shall be debited against the bowler. If other Penalty runs 
have been awarded to either side these shall be scored as stated in clause 41.18 (Penalty runs). Any runs completed 
by the batsmen or any boundary allowance shall be credited to the striker if the ball has been struck by the bat; 
otherwise they shall also be scored as Byes or Leg byes as appropriate. 

21.17  No ball not to count 

A No ball shall not count as one of the over. See clause 17.3 (Validity of balls). 

21.18  Out from a No ball 

When No ball has been called, neither batsman shall be out under any of the Playing Conditions except clause 34 
(Hit the ball twice), clause 37 (Obstructing the field) or clause 38 (Run out). 

22 WIDE BALL 

22.1  Judging a Wide 

22.1.1 

If the bowler bowls a ball, not being a No ball, the umpire shall adjudge it a Wide if, according to the 
definition in clause 22.1.2 

22.1.1.1 

the ball passes wide of where the striker is standing and which also would have passed wide of the striker 
standing in a normal guard position. 

22.1.1.2 

the ball passes above the head height of the striker standing upright at the popping crease. 

22.1.2  The ball will be considered as passing wide of the striker unless it is sufficiently within reach for him to be 

able to hit it with the bat by means of a normal cricket stroke. 

22.1.3  For bowlers attempting to utilise the rough outside a batsman’s leg stump, not necessarily as a negative 

tactic, the strict limited over Wide interpretation shall be applied. 

22.1.4  For bowlers whom umpires consider to be bowling down the leg side as a negative tactic, the strict limited 

over Wide interpretation shall be applied. 

22.2  Call and signal of Wide ball 

If the umpire adjudges a delivery to be a Wide he/she shall call and signal Wide ball as soon as the ball passes the 
striker’s wicket. It shall, however, be considered to have been a Wide from the instant that the bowler entered his 
delivery stride, even though it cannot be called Wide until it passes the striker’s wicket. 

22.3  Revoking a call of Wide ball 

22.3.1  The umpire shall revoke the call of Wide ball if there is then any contact between the ball and the striker’s 

bat or person before the ball comes into contact with any fielder. 

22.3.2  The umpire shall revoke the call of Wide ball if a delivery is called a No ball. See clause 21.13 (No ball to 

over-ride Wide). 

22.4  Delivery not a Wide 

22.4.1  The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide, if the striker, by moving, either causes the ball to 

pass wide of him, as defined in clause 22.1.2 or brings the ball sufficiently within reach to be able to hit it by 
means of a normal cricket stroke. 

36 

 

22.4.2  The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide if the ball touches the striker’s bat or person, but 

only as the ball passes the striker. 

22.5  Ball not dead 

The ball does not become dead on the call of Wide ball. 

22.6  Penalty for a Wide 

A penalty of one run shall be awarded instantly on the call of Wide ball. Unless the call is revoked, see clause 22.3, 
this penalty shall stand even if a batsman is dismissed, and shall be in addition to any other runs scored, any 
boundary allowance and any other runs awarded for penalties. 

22.7  Runs resulting from a Wide – how scored 

All runs completed by the batsmen or a boundary allowance, together with the penalty for the Wide, shall be scored 
as Wide balls. Apart from any award of 5 Penalty runs, all runs resulting from a Wide shall be debited against the 
bowler. 

22.8  Wide not to count 

A Wide shall not count as one of the over. See clause 17.3 (Validity of balls). 

22.9  Out from a Wide 

When Wide ball has been called, neither batsman shall be out under any of the Playing Conditions except clause 35 
(Hit wicket), clause 37 (Obstructing the field), clause 38 (Run out) or clause 39 (Stumped). 

23 BYE AND LEG BYE 

23.1  Byes 

If the ball, delivered by the bowler, not being a Wide, passes the striker without touching his bat or person, any runs 
completed by the batsmen from that delivery, or a boundary allowance, shall be credited as Byes to the batting side. 
Additionally, if the delivery is a No ball, the one run penalty for such a delivery shall be incurred. 

23.2  Leg byes 

23.2.1 

If a ball delivered by the bowler first strikes the person of the striker, runs shall be scored only if the umpire 
is satisfied that the striker has 

either attempted to play the ball with the bat; or 

tried to avoid being hit by the ball. 

23.2.2 

If the umpire is satisfied that either of these conditions has been met runs shall be scored as follows. 

23.2.2.1 

If there is 

either no subsequent contact with the striker’s bat or person, or 

only inadvertent contact with the striker’s bat or person, 

any runs completed by the batsmen or a boundary allowance shall be credited to the striker in 
the case of subsequent contact with his bat but otherwise to the batting side as in clause 23.2.3. 

23.2.2.2 

If the striker wilfully makes a lawful second strike, clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once) and 
clause 34.4 (Runs permitted from ball lawfully struck more than once) shall apply. 

23.2.3  The runs in clause 23.2.2.1, unless credited to the striker, shall be scored as Leg byes. 

Additionally, if the delivery is a No ball, the one run penalty for the No ball shall be incurred. 

37 

 

23.3  Leg byes not to be awarded 

If in the circumstance of clause 23.2.1 the umpire considers that neither of the conditions therein has been met, then 
Leg byes shall not be awarded. 

If the ball does not become dead for any other reason, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball as soon as the ball 
reaches the boundary or at the completion of the first run. 

The umpire shall then: 

- disallow all runs to the batting side; 

- return any not out batsman to his original end; 

- signal No ball to the scorers if applicable; 

- award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging 
to the fielding side). 

24 FIELDER’S ABSENCE; SUBSTITUTES 

24.1  Substitute fielders 

24.1.1  The umpires shall allow a substitute fielder 

24.1.1.1 

if they are satisfied that a fielder has been injured or become ill and that this occurred during the match, or 

24.1.1.2 

for any other wholly acceptable reason. 

In all other circumstances, a substitute is not allowed. 

24.1.2  A substitute shall not bowl or act as captain but may act as wicket-keeper only with the consent of the 

umpires. Note, however, clause 42.4.1. 

24.1.3  A nominated player may bowl or field even though a substitute has previously acted for him, subject to 

clauses 24.2 and 24.3. 

24.1.4  Squad members of the fielding or batting team who are not playing in the match and who are not acting as 

substitute fielders shall be required to wear a team training bib whilst on the playing area (including the area 
between the boundary and the perimeter fencing). 

24.2  Fielder absent or leaving the field of play 

24.2.1  A player going briefly outside the boundary while carrying out any duties as a fielder is not absent from the 

field of play nor, for the purposes of this clause, is he to be regarded as having left the field of play. 

24.2.2 

If a fielder fails to take the field at the start of play or at any later time, or leaves the field during play, 

24.2.2.1  an umpire shall be informed of the reason for this absence. 

24.2.2.2  he shall not thereafter come on to the field of play during a session of play without the consent of the 

umpire. See clause 24.4. The umpire shall give such consent as soon as it is practicable. 

24.2.3 

If a player is absent from the field for longer than 8 minutes, the following restrictions shall apply to their 
future participation in the match: 

38 

 

24.2.3.1  The player shall not be permitted to bowl in the match until he has either been able to field, or his team has 

subsequently been batting, for the total length of playing time for which the player was absent (hereafter 
referred to as Penalty time). A player’s unexpired Penalty time shall be limited to a maximum of 120 
minutes. If any unexpired Penalty time remains at the end of an innings, it is carried forward to the next 
and subsequent innings of the match. 

24.2.3.2  The player shall not be permitted to bat in the match until his team’s batting innings has been in progress 
for the length of playing time that is equal to the unexpired Penalty time carried forward from the previous 
innings. However, once his side has lost five wickets in its batting innings, he may bat immediately. If any 
unexpired penalty time remains at the end of that batting innings, it is carried forward to the next and 
subsequent innings of the match. 

24.2.4 

If the player leaves the field before having served all of his Penalty time, the balance is carried forward as 
unserved Penalty time. 

24.2.5  On any occasion of absence, the amount of playing time for which the player is off the field shall be added to 
any Penalty time that remains unserved, subject to a maximum cumulative Penalty time of 120 minutes, and 
that player shall not bowl until all of his Penalty time has been served. 

24.2.6  For the purposes of clauses 24.2.3.1 and 24.2.3.2, playing time shall comprise the time play is in progress 

excluding lunch and tea intervals, intervals between innings and official drinks intervals. For clarity, a 
player’s Penalty time will continue to expire after he is dismissed, for the remainder of his team’s batting 
innings. 

24.2.7 

If there is an unscheduled break in play, the stoppage time shall count as Penalty time served, provided that, 

24.2.7.1 

the fielder who was on the field of play at the start of the break either takes the field on the resumption of 
play, or his side is now batting. 

24.2.7.2 

the fielder who was already off the field at the start of the break notifies an umpire in person as soon as he 
is able to participate, and either takes the field on the resumption of play, or his side is now batting. 
Stoppage time before an umpire has been so notified shall not count towards unserved Penalty time. 

24.2.8  Any unserved Penalty time shall be carried forward into the next and subsequent days and innings of the 

match, as applicable. 

24.3  Penalty time not incurred 

A nominated player’s absence will not incur Penalty time if, 

24.3.1  he has suffered an external blow during the match and, as a result, has justifiably left the field or is unable to 

take the field. 

24.3.2 

in the opinion of the umpires, the player has been absent or has left the field for other wholly acceptable 
reasons, which shall not include illness or internal injury. 

24.3.3 

the player is absent from the field for a period of 8 minutes or less. 

24.4  Player returning without permission 

If a player comes on to the field of play in contravention of clause 24.2.2 and comes into contact with the ball while it 
is in play, the ball shall immediately become dead. 

- The umpire shall award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. 

- Runs completed by the batsmen shall be scored together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the 
instant of the offence. 

- The ball shall not count as one of the over. 

- The umpire shall inform the other umpire, the captain of the fielding side, the batsmen and, as soon as practicable, 
the captain of the batting side of the reason for this action. 

39 

 

25 BATSMAN’S INNINGS 

25.1  Eligibility to act as a batsman 

Only a nominated player may bat and, subject to clause 25.3, may do so even though a substitute fielder has 
previously acted for him. 

25.2  Commencement of a batsman’s innings 

The innings of the first two batsmen, and that of any new batsman on the resumption of play after a call of Time, shall 
commence at the call of Play. At any other time, a batsman’s innings shall be considered to have commenced when 
that batsman first steps onto the field of play. 

25.3  Restriction on batsman commencing an innings 

25.3.1 

If a member of the batting side has unserved Penalty time (see clause 24.2.7) that player shall not be 
permitted to bat until that Penalty time has been served. However, even if the unserved Penalty time has not 
expired, that player may bat after his side has lost 5 wickets. 

25.3.2  A member of the batting side’s Penalty time is served during Playing time. In the event of an unscheduled 

stoppage, the stoppage time after the batsman notifies an umpire in person that he is able to participate 
shall count as Penalty time served. 

 

25.3.3 

If any unserved Penalty time remains at the end of a team’s innings, it shall be carried forward to the next 
and subsequent innings of the match if appropriate. 

25.4  Batsman retiring 

25.4.1  A batsman may retire at any time during his innings when the ball is dead. The umpires, before allowing play 

to proceed, shall be informed of the reason for a batsman retiring. 

25.4.2 

If a batsman retires because of illness, injury or any other unavoidable cause, that batsman is entitled to 
resume his innings. If for any reason this does not happen, that batsman is to be recorded as ‘Retired - not 
out’. 

25.4.3 

If a batsman retires for any reason other than as in clause 25.4.2, the innings of that batsman may be 
resumed only with the consent of the opposing captain. If for any reason his innings is not resumed, that 
batsman is to be recorded as ‘Retired - out’. 

25.4.4 

If after retiring a batsman resumes his innings, subject to the requirements of clauses 25.4.2 and 25.4.3, it 
shall be only at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of another batsman. 

25.5  Runners 

Runners shall not be permitted. 

26 PRACTICE ON THE FIELD 

26.1  Practice on the pitch or the rest of the square 

26.1.1  There shall not be any practice on the pitch at any time on any day of the match. 

26.1.2  There shall not be any practice on the rest of the square at any time on any day of the match, except with 

the approval of the umpires. 

40 

 

26.1.2.1 

If approved by the umpires, the use of the square for practice on any day of any match will be restricted to 
any netted practice area or bowling strips specifically prepared on the edge of the square for that purpose. 

26.1.2.2  Bowling practice on the bowling strips referred to above shall also be permitted during the interval (and 

change of innings if not the interval) unless the umpires consider that, in the prevailing conditions of 
ground and weather, it will be detrimental to the surface of the square. 

26.2  Practice on the outfield 

26.2.1  On any day of the match, all forms of practice are permitted on the outfield 

- before the start of play; 

- after the close of play; and 

- during the lunch and tea intervals or between innings, 

providing the umpires are satisfied that such practice will not cause significant deterioration in the condition 
of the outfield. 

26.2.2  Between the call of Play and the call of Time, practice shall be permitted on the outfield, providing that all of 

the following conditions are met: 

- only the fielders (as defined in paragraph 7 of Appendix A) participate in such practice. 

- no ball other than the match ball is used for this practice. 

- no bowling practice takes place in the area between the square and the boundary in a direction parallel to 
the match pitch. 

- the umpires are satisfied that it will not contravene either of clauses 41.3 (The match ball changing its 
condition) or 41.9 (Time wasting by the fielding side). 

Bowling a ball, using a short run up to a player in the outfield is not to be regarded as bowling practice but 
shall be subject to the other conditions in this clause. 

26.3  Trial run-up 

A bowler is permitted to have a trial run-up provided the umpire is satisfied that it will not contravene either of clauses 
41.9 (Time wasting by the fielding side) or 41.12 (Fielder damaging the pitch). 

26.4  Penalties for contravention 

All forms of practice are subject to the provisions of clauses 41.13 (The match ball – changing its condition), 41.9 
(Time wasting by the fielding side) and 41.12 (Fielder damaging the pitch). 

26.4.1 

If there is a contravention of any of the provisions of clause 26.1 or 26.2, the umpire shall 

- warn the player that the practice is not permitted; 

- inform the other umpire and, as soon as practicable, both captains of the reason for this action. 

26.4.1.1 

If the contravention is by a batsman at the wicket, the umpire shall inform the other batsman and each 
incoming batsman that the warning has been issued. The warning shall apply to the team of that player 
throughout the match. 

26.4.2 

If during the match there is any further contravention by any player of that team, the umpire shall 

- award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side; 

- inform the other umpire, the scorers and, as soon as practicable, both captains, and, if the contravention is 
during play, the batsmen at the wicket. 

41 

 

27 THE WICKET-KEEPER 

27.1  Protective equipment 

The wicket-keeper is the only fielder permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards. If these are worn, they are to 
be regarded as part of his person for the purposes of clause 28.2 (Fielding the ball). If by the wicket-keeper’s actions 
and positioning when the ball comes into play it is apparent to the umpires that he will not be able to carry out the 
normal duties of a wicket-keeper, he shall forfeit this right and also the right to be recognised as a wicket-keeper for 
the purposes of clauses 33.2 (A fair catch), 39 (Stumped), 28.1 (Protective equipment), 28.4 (Limitation of on-side 
fielders) and 28.5 (Fielders not to encroach on pitch). 

27.2  Gloves 

27.2.1 

If, as permitted under clause 27.1, the wicket-keeper wears gloves, they shall have no webbing between the 
fingers except joining index finger and thumb, where webbing may be inserted as a means of support. 

27.2.2 

If used, the webbing shall be a single piece of non-stretch material which, although it may have facing 
material attached, shall have no reinforcements or tucks. 

27.2.3  The top edge of the webbing shall not protrude beyond the straight line joining the top of the index finger to 

the top of the thumb and shall be taut when a hand wearing the glove has the thumb fully extended. See 
paragraph 3 of Appendix B. 

27.3  Position of wicket-keeper 

27.3.1  The wicket-keeper shall remain wholly behind the wicket at the striker’s end from the moment the ball comes 

into play until a ball delivered by the bowler: 

touches the bat or person of the striker; or 

passes the wicket at the striker’s end; or 

the striker attempts a run. 

27.3.2 

In the event of the wicket-keeper contravening this clause, the striker’s end umpire shall call and signal No 
ball as soon as applicable after the delivery of the ball. 

27.4  Movement by wicket-keeper 

27.4.1  After the ball comes into play and before it reaches the striker, it is unfair if the wicket-keeper significantly 

alters his position in relation to the striker’s wicket, except for the following: 

27.4.1.1  movement of a few paces forward for a slower delivery, unless in so doing it brings him within reach of the 

wicket. 

27.4.1.2 

lateral movement in response to the direction in which the ball has been delivered. 

27.4.1.3  movement in response to the stroke that the striker is playing or that his actions suggest he intends to 

play. However the provisions of clause 27.3 shall apply. 

27.4.2 

In the event of unfair movement by the wicket-keeper, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball. 

27.5  Restriction on actions of wicket-keeper 

If, in the opinion of either umpire, the wicket-keeper interferes with the striker’s right to play the ball and to guard his 
wicket, clause 20.4.2.6 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball) shall apply. 

If, however, either umpire considers that the interference by the wicket-keeper was wilful, then clause 41.4 
(Deliberate attempt to distract striker) shall also apply. 

27.6 

Interference with wicket-keeper by striker 

If, in playing at the ball or in the legitimate defence of his wicket, the striker interferes with the wicket-keeper, he shall 
not be out except as provided for in clause 37.3 (Obstructing a ball from being caught). 

42 

 

28 THE FIELDER 

28.1  Protective equipment 

No fielder other than the wicket-keeper shall be permitted to wear gloves or external leg guards. In addition, 
protection for the hand or fingers may be worn only with the consent of the umpires. 

28.2  Fielding the ball 

28.2.1  A fielder may field the ball with any part of his person (see paragraph 12 of Appendix A), except as in clause 

28.2.1.2. However, he will be deemed to have fielded the ball illegally if, while the ball is in play he wilfully: 

28.2.1.1  uses anything other than part of his person to field the ball. 

28.2.1.2  extends his clothing with his hands and uses this to field the ball. 

28.2.1.3  discards a piece of clothing, equipment or any other object which subsequently makes contact with the 

ball. 

28.2.2 

It is not illegal fielding if the ball in play makes contact with a piece of clothing, equipment or any other object 
which has accidentally fallen from the fielder’s person. 

28.2.3 

If a fielder illegally fields the ball, the ball shall immediately become dead and 

- the penalty for a No ball or a Wide shall stand. 

- any runs completed by the batsmen shall be credited to the batting side, together with the run in progress if 
the batsmen had already crossed at the instant of the offence. 

- the ball shall not count as one of the over. 

In addition the umpire shall: 

- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. 

- inform the other umpire and the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. 

- inform the batsmen and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. 

28.3  Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side 

28.3.1  Protective helmets, when not in use by fielders, may not be placed on the ground, above the surface except 

behind the wicket-keeper and in line with both sets of stumps. 

28.3.2 

If the ball while in play strikes a helmet, placed as described in clause 28.3.1, 

28.3.2.1 

the ball shall become dead 

and, subject to clause 28.3.3, 

28.3.2.2  an award of 5 Penalty runs shall be made to the batting side; 

28.3.2.3  any runs completed by the batsmen before the ball strikes the protective helmet shall be scored, together 
with the run in progress if the batsmen had already crossed at the instant of the ball striking the protective 
helmet. 

28.3.3 

If the ball while in play strikes a helmet, placed as described in clause 28.3.1, unless the circumstances of 
clause 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded) or clause 34 (Hit the ball twice), apply, the umpire shall: 

- permit the batsmen’s runs as in clause 28.3.2.3 to be scored 

- signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers if applicable 

- award 5 Penalty runs as in clause 28.3.2.2 

- award any other Penalty runs due to the batting side. 

43 

 

28.3.4 

If the ball while in play strikes a helmet, placed as described in clause 28.3.1, and the circumstances of 
clause 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded) or clause 34 (Hit the ball twice) apply, the umpire shall: 

- disallow all runs to the batting side 

- return any not out batsman to his original end 

- signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers if applicable 

- award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3.2. 

28.4  Limitation of on side fielders 

At the instant of the bowler’s delivery there shall not be more than two fielders, other than the wicket-keeper, behind 
the popping crease on the on side. A fielder will be considered to be behind the popping crease unless the whole of 
his person whether grounded or in the air is in front of this line. 

In the event of infringement of this clause by any fielder, the striker’s end umpire shall call and signal No ball. 

28.5  Fielders not to encroach on pitch 

While the ball is in play and until the ball has made contact with the striker’s bat or person, or has passed the striker’s 
bat, no fielder, other than the bowler, may have any part of his person grounded on or extended over the pitch. 

In the event of infringement of this clause by any fielder other than the wicket-keeper, the bowler’s end umpire shall 
call and signal No ball as soon as possible after delivery of the ball. Note, however, clause 27.3 (Position of wicket-
keeper). 

28.6  Movement by any fielder other than the wicket-keeper 

28.6.1  Any movement by any fielder, excluding the wicket-keeper, after the ball comes into play and before the ball 

reaches the striker, is unfair except for the following: 

28.6.1.1  minor adjustments to stance or position in relation to the striker’s wicket. 

28.6.1.2  movement by any fielder, other than a close fielder, towards the striker or the striker’s wicket that does not 

significantly alter the position of the fielder. 

28.6.1.3  movement by any fielder in response to the stroke that the striker is playing or that his actions suggest he 

intends to play. 

28.6.2 

In all circumstances clause 28.4 (Limitation of on side fielders) shall apply. 

28.6.3 

In the event of such unfair movement, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball. 

28.6.4  Note also the provisions of clause 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to distract striker). See also clause 27.4 

(Movement by wicket-keeper). 

29 THE WICKET IS DOWN 

29.1  Wicket put down 

29.1.1  The wicket is put down if a bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps, or a stump is struck out of 

the ground, 

44 

 

29.1.1.1  by the ball, 

29.1.1.2  by the striker’s bat if held or by any part of the bat that he is holding, 

29.1.1.3 

for the purpose of this clause only, by the striker's bat not in hand, or by any part of the bat which has 
become detached, 

29.1.1.4  by the striker’s person or by any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached from his person, 

29.1.1.5  by a fielder with his hand or arm, providing that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the 

hand of the arm so used. 

29.1.1.6  The wicket is also put down if a fielder strikes or pulls a stump out of the ground in the same manner. 

29.1.2  The disturbance of a bail, whether temporary or not, shall not constitute its complete removal from the top of 

the stumps, but if a bail in falling lodges between two of the stumps this shall be regarded as complete 
removal. 

29.2  One bail off 

If one bail is off, it shall be sufficient for the purpose of putting the wicket down to remove the remaining bail or to 
strike or pull any of the three stumps out of the ground, in any of the ways stated in clause 29.1. 

29.3  Remaking wicket 

If a wicket is broken or put down while the ball is in play, it shall not be remade by an umpire until the ball is dead. 
See clause 20 (Dead ball). Any fielder may, however, while the ball is in play, 

- replace a bail or bails on top of the stumps. 

- put back one or more stumps into the ground where the wicket originally stood. 

29.4  Dispensing with bails 

If the umpires have agreed to dispense with bails in accordance with clause 8.4 (Dispensing with bails), it is for the 
umpire concerned to decide whether or not the wicket has been put down. 

29.4.1  After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been put down if the umpire concerned is satisfied that 

the wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker’s bat, person or items of his clothing or equipment as 
described in clauses 29.1.1.2, 29.1.1.3 or 29.1.1.4, or by a fielder in the manner described in clause 
29.1.1.5. 

29.4.2 

If the wicket has already been broken or put down, clause 29.4.1 shall apply to any stump or stumps still in 
the ground. Any fielder may replace a stump or stumps, in accordance with clause 29.3, in order to have an 
opportunity of putting the wicket down. 

30 BATSMAN OUT OF HIS GROUND 

30.1  When out of his ground 

30.1.1  A batsman shall be considered to be out of his ground unless some part of his person or bat is grounded 

behind the popping crease at that end. 

30.1.2  However, a batsman shall not be considered to be out of his ground if, in running or diving towards his 

ground and beyond, and having grounded some part of his person or bat beyond the popping crease, there 
is subsequent loss of contact: 

between the ground and any part of his person or bat; or 

between the bat and person, 

provided that the batsman has continued movement in the same direction. 

45 

 

30.2  Which is a batsman’s ground 

30.2.1 

If only one batsman is within a ground, it is his ground and will remain so even if he is later joined there by 
the other batsman. 

30.2.2 

If both batsmen are in the same ground and one of them subsequently leaves it, the ground belongs to the 
batsman who remains in it. 

30.2.3 

If there is no batsman in either ground, then each ground belongs to whichever batsman is nearer to it, or, if 
the batsmen are level, to whichever batsman was nearer to it immediately prior to their drawing level. 

30.2.4 

If a ground belongs to one batsman then the other ground belongs to the other batsman, irrespective of his 
position. 

30.3  Position of non-striker 

The non-striker, when standing at the bowler’s end, should be positioned on the opposite side of the wicket to that 
from which the ball is being delivered, unless a request to do otherwise is granted by the umpire. 

31 APPEALS 

31.1  Umpire not to give batsman out without an appeal 

Neither umpire shall give a batsman out, even though he may be out under these Playing Conditions, unless 
appealed to by a fielder. This shall not debar a batsman who is out under these Playing Conditions from leaving the 
wicket without an appeal having been made. Note, however, the provisions of clause 31.7. 

31.2  Batsman dismissed 

A batsman is dismissed if he is 

either given out by an umpire, on appeal 

or out under these Playing Conditions and leaves the wicket as in clause 31.1. 

31.3  Timing of appeals 

For an appeal to be valid, it must be made before the bowler begins his run-up or, if there is no run-up, his bowling 
action to deliver the next ball, and before Time has been called. 

The call of Over does not invalidate an appeal made prior to the start of the following over, provided Time has not 
been called. See clauses 12.2 (Call of Time) and 17.2 (Start of an over). 

31.4  Appeal “How’s That?” 

An appeal “How’s That?” covers all ways of being out. 

31.5  Answering appeals 

The striker’s end umpire shall answer all appeals arising out of any of clauses 35 (Hit wicket), 39 (Stumped) or 38 
(Run out) when this occurs at the wicket-keeper’s end. The bowler’s end umpire shall answer all other appeals. 

When an appeal is made, each umpire shall answer on any matter that falls within his jurisdiction. 

When a batsman has been given Not out, either umpire may answer an appeal, made in accordance with clause 
31.3, if it is on a further matter and is within his jurisdiction. 

31.6  Consultation by umpires 

Each umpire shall answer appeals on matters within his own jurisdiction. If an umpire is doubtful about any point that 
the other umpire may have been in a better position to see, he/she shall consult the latter on this point of fact and 
shall then give the decision. If, after consultation, there is still doubt remaining, the decision shall be Not out. 

46 

 

31.7  Batsman leaving the wicket under a misapprehension 

An umpire shall intervene if satisfied that a batsman, not having been given out, has left the wicket under a 
misapprehension of being out. The umpire intervening shall call and signal Dead ball to prevent any further action by 
the fielding side and shall recall the batsman. 

A batsman may be recalled at any time up to the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery, unless it 
is the final wicket of the innings, in which case it should be up to the instant when the umpires leave the field. 

31.8  Withdrawal of an appeal 

The captain of the fielding side may withdraw an appeal only after obtaining the consent of the umpire within whose 
jurisdiction the appeal falls. If such consent is given, the umpire concerned shall, if applicable, revoke the decision 
and recall the batsman. 

The withdrawal of an appeal must be before the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery or, if the 
innings has been completed, the instant when the umpires leave the field. 

32 BOWLED 

32.1  Out Bowled 

32.1.1  The striker is out Bowled if his wicket is put down by a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a No ball, even 

if it first touches the striker’s bat or person. 

32.1.2  However, the striker shall not be out Bowled if before striking the wicket the ball has been in contact with any 
other player or an umpire. The striker will, however, be subject to clauses 37 (Obstructing the field), 38 (Run 
out) and 39 (Stumped). 

32.2  Bowled to take precedence 

The striker is out Bowled if his wicket is put down as in clause 32.1, even though a decision against him for any other 
method of dismissal would be justified. 

33 CAUGHT 

33.1  Out Caught 

The striker is out Caught if a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a No ball, touches his bat without having 
previously been in contact with any fielder, and is subsequently held by a fielder as a fair catch, as described in 
clauses 33.2 and 33.3, before it touches the ground. 

33.2  A fair catch 

33.2.1  A catch will be fair only if, in every case 

either the ball, at any time 

or any fielder in contact with the ball, 

is not grounded beyond the boundary before the catch is completed. Note clauses 19.4 (Ball grounded 
beyond the boundary) and 19.5 (Fielder grounded beyond the boundary). 

33.2.2  Furthermore, a catch will be fair if any of the following conditions applies: 

47 

 

33.2.2.1 

the ball is held in the hand or hands of a fielder, even if the hand holding the ball is touching the ground, or 
is hugged to the body, or lodges in the external protective equipment worn by a fielder, or lodges 
accidentally in a fielder’s clothing. 

33.2.2.2  a fielder catches the ball after it has been lawfully struck more than once by the striker, but only if it has not 

been grounded since it was first struck. See clause 34 (Hit the ball twice). 

33.2.2.3  a fielder catches the ball after it has touched the wicket, an umpire, another fielder or the other batsman. 

33.2.2.4  a fielder catches the ball after it has crossed the boundary in the air, provided that the conditions in clause 

33.2.1 are met. 

33.2.2.5 

the ball is caught off an obstruction within the boundary that is not designated a boundary by the umpires. 

33.3  Making a catch 

The act of making a catch shall start from the time when the ball first comes into contact with a fielder’s person and 
shall end when a fielder obtains complete control over both the ball and his own movement. 

33.4  No runs to be scored 

If the striker is dismissed Caught, runs from that delivery completed by the batsmen before the completion of the 
catch shall not be scored but any runs for penalties awarded to either side shall stand. Clause 18.11.1 (Batsman 
returning to original end) shall apply from the instant of the completion of the catch. 

33.5  Caught to take precedence 

If the criteria of clause 33.1 are met and the striker is not out Bowled, then he is out Caught, even though a decision 
against either batsman for another method of dismissal would be justified. 

34 HIT THE BALL TWICE 

34.1  Out Hit the ball twice 

34.1.1  The striker is out Hit the ball twice if, while the ball is in play, it strikes any part of his person or is struck by 
his bat and, before the ball has been touched by a fielder, the striker wilfully strikes it again with his bat or 
person, other than a hand not holding the bat, except for the sole purpose of guarding his wicket. See clause 
34.3 and clause 37 (Obstructing the field). 

34.1.2  For the purpose of this clause ‘struck’ or ‘strike’ shall include contact with the person of the striker. 

34.2  Not out Hit the ball twice 

The striker will not be out under this clause if he: 

34.2.1  strikes the ball a second or subsequent time in order to return the ball to any fielder.  

Note, however, the provisions of clause 37.4 (Returning the ball to a fielder). 

34.2.2  wilfully strikes the ball after it has touched a fielder. Note, however the provisions of clause 37.1 (Out 

Obstructing the field). 

34.3  Ball lawfully struck more than once 

The striker may, solely in order to guard his wicket and before the ball has been touched by a fielder, lawfully strike 
the ball a second or subsequent time with the bat, or with any part of his person other than a hand not holding the 
bat. 

However, the striker may not prevent the ball from being caught by striking the ball more than once in defence of his 
wicket. See clause 37.3 (Obstructing a ball from being caught). 

48 

 

34.4  Runs permitted from ball lawfully struck more than once 

When the ball is lawfully struck more than once, as permitted in clause 34.3, if the ball does not become dead for any 
reason, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball as soon as the ball reaches the boundary or at the completion of 
the first run. However, the umpire shall delay the call of Dead ball to allow the opportunity for a catch to be 
completed. 

The umpire shall 

- disallow all runs to the batting side; 

- return any not out batsman to his original end; 

- signal No ball to the scorers if applicable; and 

- award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging 
to the fielding side). 

34.5  Bowler does not get credit 

The bowler does not get credit for the wicket. 

35 HIT WICKET 

35.1  Out Hit wicket 

35.1.1  The striker is out Hit wicket if, after the bowler has entered the delivery stride and while the ball is in play, his 

wicket is put down by either the striker’s bat or person as described in clauses 29.1.1.2 to 29.1.1.4 (Wicket 
put down) in any of the following circumstances: 

35.1.1.1 

in the course of any action taken by him in preparing to receive or in receiving a delivery, 

35.1.1.2 

in setting off for the first run immediately after playing or playing at the ball, 

35.1.1.3 

if no attempt is made to play the ball, in setting off for the first run, providing that in the opinion of the 
umpire this is immediately after the striker has had the opportunity of playing the ball, 

35.1.1.4 

in lawfully making a second or further stroke for the purpose of guarding his wicket within the provisions of 
clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once). 

35.1.2 

If the striker puts his wicket down in any of the ways described in clauses 29.1.1.2 to 29.1.1.4 before the 
bowler has entered the delivery stride, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball. 

35.2  Not out Hit wicket 

The striker is not out under this clause should his wicket be put down in any of the ways referred to in clause 35.1 if 
any of the following applies: 

- it occurs after the striker has completed any action in receiving the delivery, other than in clauses 35.1.1.2 
to 35.1.1.4. 

- it occurs when the striker is in the act of running, other than setting off immediately for the first run. 

- it occurs when the striker is trying to avoid being run out or stumped. 

- it occurs when the striker is trying to avoid a throw in at any time. 

- the bowler after entering the delivery stride does not deliver the ball. In this case either umpire shall 
immediately call and signal Dead ball. See clause 20.4 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball). 

- the delivery is a No ball. 

49 

 

36 LEG BEFORE WICKET 

36.1  Out LBW 

The striker is out LBW if all the circumstances set out in clauses 36.1.1 to 36.1.5 apply: 

36.1.1  The bowler delivers a ball, not being a No ball 

36.1.2 

the ball, if it is not intercepted full-pitch, pitches in line between wicket and wicket or on the off side of the 
striker’s wicket 

36.1.3 

the ball not having previously touched his bat, the striker intercepts the ball, either full-pitch or after pitching, 
with any part of his person 

36.1.4 

the point of impact, even if above the level of the bails, 

either is between wicket and wicket 

or if the striker has made no genuine attempt to play the ball with the bat, is 

between wicket and wicket or outside the line of the off stump. 

36.1.5  but for the interception, the ball would have hit the wicket. 

36.2 

Interception of the ball 

36.2.1 

In assessing points of impact in clauses 36.1.3, 36.1.4 and 36.1.5, only the first interception is to be 
considered. 

36.2.2 

In assessing 36.1.3, if the bowler’s end umpire is not satisfied that the ball intercepted the batsman’s person 
before it touched the bat, the batsman shall be given Not out. 

36.2.3 

In assessing clause 36.1.5, it is to be assumed that the path of the ball before interception would have 
continued after interception, irrespective of whether the ball might have pitched subsequently or not. 

36.3  Off side of wicket 

The off side of the striker’s wicket shall be determined by the striker’s stance at the moment the ball comes into play 
for that delivery. See paragraph 13 of Appendix A. 

37 OBSTRUCTING THE FIELD 

37.1  Out Obstructing the field 

37.1.1  Either batsman is out Obstructing the field if, except in the circumstances of clause 37.2, and while the ball 
is in play, he wilfully attempts to obstruct or distract the fielding side by word or action. See also clause 34 
(Hit the ball twice). 

37.1.2  The striker is out Obstructing the field if, except in the circumstances of clause 37.2, in the act of receiving a 

ball delivered by the bowler, he wilfully strikes the ball with a hand not holding the bat. This will apply 
whether it is the first strike or a second or subsequent strike. The act of receiving the ball shall extend both 
to playing at the ball and to striking the ball more than once in defence of his wicket. 

37.1.3  This clause will apply whether or not No ball is called. 

37.1.4  For the avoidance of doubt, if an umpire feels that a batsman, in running between the wickets, has 

significantly changed his direction without probable cause and thereby obstructed a fielder’s attempt to effect 
a run out, the batsman should, on appeal, be given out, obstructing the field. It shall not be relevant whether 
a run out would have occurred or not. 

If the change of direction involves the batsman crossing the pitch, clause 41.14 shall also apply. 

See also paragraph 2.2 of Appendix D. 

50 

 

37.2  Not out Obstructing the field 

A batsman shall not be out Obstructing the field if 

obstruction or distraction is accidental, or 

obstruction is in order to avoid injury, or 

in the case of the striker, he makes a second or subsequent strike to guard his wicket lawfully as in clause 34.3 (Ball 
lawfully struck more than once). However, see clause 37.3. 

37.3  Obstructing a ball from being caught 

The striker is out Obstructing the field should wilful obstruction or distraction by either batsman prevent a catch being 
completed. This shall apply even though the obstruction is caused by the striker in lawfully guarding his wicket under 
the provision of clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once). 

37.4  Returning the ball to a fielder 

Either batsman is out Obstructing the field if, at any time while the ball is in play and, without the consent of a fielder, 
he uses the bat or any part of his person to return the ball to any fielder. 

37.5  Runs scored 

When either batsman is dismissed Obstructing the field, 

37.5.1  unless the obstruction prevents a catch from being made, any runs completed by the batsmen before the 

offence shall be scored, together with any runs awarded for penalties to either side. See clauses 18.6 (Runs 
awarded for penalties) and 18.8 (Runs scored when a batsman is dismissed). 

37.5.2 

if the obstruction prevents a catch from being made, any runs completed by the batsmen shall not be scored 
but any penalties awarded to either side shall stand. 

37.6  Bowler does not get credit 

The bowler does not get credit for the wicket. 

38 RUN OUT 

38.1  Out Run out 

Either batsman is out Run out, except as in clause 38.2, if, at any time while the ball is in play, 

he is out of his ground 

and his wicket is fairly put down by the action of a fielder 

even though No ball has been called, except in the circumstances of clause 38.2.2.2, and whether or not a run is 
being attempted. 

38.2  Batsman not out Run out 

38.2.1  A batsman is not out Run out in the circumstances of clauses 38.2.1.1 or 38.2.1.2. 

38.2.1.1  He has been within his ground and has subsequently left it to avoid injury, when the wicket is put down. 

Note also the provisions of clause 30.1.2 (When out of his ground). 

38.2.1.2  The ball, delivered by the bowler, has not made contact with a fielder before the wicket is put down. 

38.2.2  The striker is not out Run out in any of the circumstances in clauses 38.2.2.1 and 38.2.2.2. 

51 

 

38.2.2.1  He is out Stumped. See clause 39.1.2 (Out Stumped). 

38.2.2.2  No ball has been called 

and he is out of his ground not attempting a run 

and the wicket is fairly put down by the wicket-keeper without the intervention of another fielder. 

38.3  Which batsman is out 

The batsman out in the circumstances of clause 38.1 is the one whose ground is at the end where the wicket is put 
down. See clause 30.2 (Which is a batsman’s ground). 

38.4  Runs scored 

If either batsman is dismissed Run out, the run in progress when the wicket is put down shall not be scored, but any 
runs completed by the batsmen shall stand, together with any runs for penalties awarded to either side. See clauses 
18.6 (Runs awarded for penalties) and 18.8 (Runs scored when a batsman is dismissed). 

38.5  Bowler does not get credit 

The bowler does not get credit for the wicket. 

39 STUMPED 

39.1  Out Stumped 

39.1.1  The striker is out Stumped, except as in clause 39.3, if: 

a ball which is delivered is not called No ball 

and he is out of his ground, other than as in clause 39.3.1 

and he has not attempted a run 

when his wicket is fairly put down by the wicket-keeper without the intervention of another fielder. Note, 
however clause 27.3 (Position of wicket-keeper). 

39.1.2  The striker is out Stumped if all the conditions of clause 39.1.1 are satisfied, even though a decision of Run 

out would be justified. 

39.2  Ball rebounding from wicket-keeper’s person 

If the wicket is put down by the ball, it shall be regarded as having been put down by the wicket-keeper if the ball 
rebounds on to the stumps from any part of the wicket-keeper’s person or equipment or has been kicked or thrown on 
to the stumps by the wicket-keeper. 

39.3  Not out Stumped 

39.3.1  The striker will not be out Stumped if he has left his ground in order to avoid injury. 

39.3.2 

If the striker is not out Stumped he may, except in the circumstances of 38.2.2.2 (Batsman not out Run out), 
be out Run out if the conditions of clause 38.1 (Out Run out) apply. 

40 TIMED OUT 

40.1  Out Timed out 

40.1.1  After the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batsman, the incoming batsman must, unless Time has been 

called, be in position to take guard or for the other batsman to be ready to receive the next ball within 3 
minutes of the dismissal or retirement. If this requirement is not met, the incoming batsman will be out, 
Timed out. 

52 

 

40.1.2 

In the event of an extended delay in which no batsman comes to the wicket, the umpires shall adopt the 
procedure of clause 16.2 (ICC Match Referee awarding a match). For the purposes of that clause the start 
of the action shall be taken as the expiry of the 3 minutes referred to above. 

40.2  Bowler does not get credit 

The bowler does not get credit for the wicket. 

41 UNFAIR PLAY 

41.1  Fair and unfair play – responsibility of captains 

The captains are responsible for ensuring that play is conducted within the Spirit of Cricket, as well as within these 
Playing Conditions. 

41.2  Fair and unfair play – responsibility of umpires 

The umpires shall be the sole judges of fair and unfair play. If either umpire considers an action, not covered by these 
Playing Conditions, to be unfair he/she shall intervene without appeal and, if the ball is in play, call and signal Dead 
ball and implement the procedure as set out in clause 41.9. Otherwise umpires shall not interfere with the progress of 
play without appeal except as required to do so by these Playing Conditions. 

41.3  The match ball – changing its condition 

41.3.1  The umpires shall make frequent and irregular inspections of the ball. In addition, they shall immediately 

inspect the ball if they suspect anyone of attempting to change the condition of the ball, except as permitted 
in clause 41.3.2. 

41.3.2 

It is an offence for any player to take any action which changes the condition of the ball. 

Except in carrying out his normal duties, a batsman is not allowed to wilfully damage the ball other than, 
when the ball is in play, in striking it with the bat. See also clause 5.5 (Damage to the ball). 

A fielder may, however: 

41.3.2.1  polish the ball on his clothing provided that no artificial substance is used and that such polishing 

wastes no time. 

41.3.2.2 

remove mud from the ball under the supervision of an umpire. 

41.3.2.3  dry a wet ball on a piece of cloth that has been approved by the umpires. 

41.3.3  The umpires shall consider the condition of the ball to have been unfairly changed if any action by any 

player does not comply with the conditions in clause 41.3.2. 

41.3.4 

If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly changed by a member or 
members of either side, or that its condition is inconsistent with the use it has received, they shall consider 
that there has been a contravention of this clause and decide together whether they can identify the 
player(s) responsible for such conduct. 

41.3.5 

If it is possible to identify the player(s) responsible for changing the condition of the ball, the umpires shall: 

41.3.5.1  Change the ball forthwith.  

41.3.5.1.1   

If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly 
changed by a member or members of the fielding side, the batsman at the wicket 
shall choose the replacement ball from a selection of six other balls of various 
degrees of usage (including a new ball) and of the same brand as the ball in use 
prior to the contravention. 

41.3.5.1.2 

If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly 
changed by a member or members of the batting side, the umpires shall select and 

53 

 

bring into use immediately, a ball which shall have wear comparable to that of the 
previous ball immediately prior to the contravention. 

41.3.5.2  Additionally, the bowler’s end umpire shall: 

- award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side. 

- if appropriate, inform the batsmen at the wicket and the captain of the fielding side that the ball 
has been changed and the reason for their action. 

- inform the captain of the batting side as soon as practicable of what has occurred. 

The umpires shall then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as 
is considered appropriate against the player(s) concerned. 

41.3.6 

If it is not possible to identify the player(s) responsible for changing the condition of the ball, the umpires 
shall: 

41.3.6.1  Change the ball forthwith. The umpires shall choose the replacement ball for one of similar wear 

and of the same brand as the ball in use prior to the contravention. 

41.3.6.2  The bowler’s end umpire shall issue the captain with a first and final warning, and 

41.3.6.3  Advise the captain that should there be any further instances of changing the condition of the ball 

by that team during the remainder of the series, clause 41.3.5.2 above will be adopted, with the 
captain deemed to be the player responsible for the contravention. 

41.4  Deliberate attempt to distract striker 

41.4.1 

It is unfair for any fielder deliberately to attempt to distract the striker while he is preparing to receive or 
receiving a delivery. 

41.4.2 

If either umpire considers that any action by a fielder is such an attempt, he/she shall immediately call and 
signal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. The bowler’s end umpire shall 

- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. 

- inform the captain of the fielding side, the batsmen and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting 
side of the reason for the action. 

Neither batsman shall be dismissed from that delivery and the ball shall not count as one of the over. 

The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is 
considered appropriate against the fielder concerned. 

41.5  Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batsman 

41.5.1 

In addition to clause 41.4, it is unfair for any fielder wilfully to attempt, by word or action, to distract, deceive 
or obstruct either batsman after the striker has received the ball. 

41.5.2 

It is for either one of the umpires to decide whether any distraction, deception or obstruction is wilful or not. 

41.5.3 

If either umpire considers that a fielder has caused or attempted to cause such a distraction, deception or 
obstruction, he/she shall immediately call and signal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for 
the call. 

41.5.4  Neither batsman shall be dismissed from that delivery. 

41.5.5 

If an obstruction involves physical contact, the umpires together shall decide whether or not an offence 
under clause 42 (Players’ conduct) has been committed. 

54 

 

41.5.5.1 

If an offence under clause 42 (Players’ conduct) has been committed, they shall apply the relevant 
procedures in clause 42 and shall also apply each of clauses 41.5.7 to 41.5.9. 

41.5.5.2 

If they consider that there has been no offence under clause 42 (Players’ conduct), they shall apply each 
of clauses 41.5.6 to 41.5.10. 

41.5.6  The bowler’s end umpire shall; 

- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. 

- inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action and as soon as practicable inform the 
captain of the batting side. 

41.5.7  The ball shall not count as one of the over. 

41.5.8  Any runs completed by the batsmen before the offence shall be scored, together with any runs for penalties 

awarded to either side. Additionally, the run in progress shall be scored whether or not the batsmen had 
already crossed at the instant of the offence. 

41.5.9  The batsmen at the wicket shall decide which of them is to face the next delivery. 

41.5.10  The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is 

considered appropriate against the fielder concerned. 

41.6  Bowling of dangerous and unfair short pitched deliveries 

41.6.1  Notwithstanding clause 41.6.2, the bowling of short pitched deliveries is dangerous if the bowler’s end 

umpire considers that, taking into consideration the skill of the striker, by their speed, length, height and 
direction they are likely to inflict physical injury on him. The fact that the striker is wearing protective 
equipment shall be disregarded. 

In the first instance the umpire decides that the bowling of short pitched deliveries has become dangerous 
under 41.6.1: 

41.6.1.1  The umpire shall call and signal No ball, and when the ball is dead, caution the bowler and inform the other 

umpire, the captain of the fielding side and the batsmen of what has occurred. This caution shall apply to 
that bowler throughout the innings. 

41.6.1.2 

If there is a second instance, the umpire shall repeat the above procedure and indicate to the bowler that 
this is a final warning, which shall apply to that bowler throughout the innings. 

41.6.1.3  Should there be any further instance by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall: 

- call and signal No ball 

- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately 
from bowling 

- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. 

The bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. 

If applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any 
part of the previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. 

- The umpire shall report the occurrence to the batsmen and, as soon as practicable, to the 
captain of the batting side. 

The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as 
is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. 

41.6.2  A bowler shall be limited to two fast short-pitched deliveries per over. 

41.6.3  A fast short-pitched delivery is defined as a ball, which passes or would have passed above the shoulder 

height of the striker standing upright at the popping crease. 

55 

 

41.6.4  The umpire at the bowler’s end shall advise the bowler and the batsman on strike when each fast short 

pitched delivery has been bowled. 

41.6.5 

In addition, a ball that passes above head height of the batsman, standing upright at the popping crease, 
that prevents him from being able to hit it with his bat by means of a normal cricket stroke shall be called a 
Wide. See also clause 22.1.1.2 

41.6.5.1  For the avoidance of doubt any fast short pitched delivery that is called a Wide under this playing condition 

shall also count as one of the allowable short pitched deliveries in that over. 

41.6.6 

In the event of a bowler bowling more than two fast short-pitched deliveries in an over as defined in clause 
41.6.3 above, the umpire at the bowler’s end shall call and signal No ball on each occasion. A differential 
signal shall be used to signify a fast short pitched delivery. The umpire shall call and signal ‘No ball’ and 
then tap the head with the other hand. 

41.6.7 

If a bowler delivers a third fast short pitched ball in an over, the umpire, after the call of No ball and when the 
ball is dead, shall caution the bowler, inform the other umpire, the captain of the fielding side and the 
batsmen at the wicket of what has occurred. This caution shall apply throughout the innings. 

41.6.8 

If there is a second instance of the bowler being No balled in the innings for bowling more than two fast short 
pitched deliveries in an over, the umpire shall advise the bowler that this is his final warning for the innings. 

41.6.9  Should there be any further instance by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall: 

- call and signal No ball 

- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately 
from bowling 

- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. 

The bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. 

If applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any 
part of the previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. 

- The umpire shall report the occurrence to the batsmen and, as soon as practicable, to the 
captain of the batting side. 

The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as 
is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. 

41.6.10  Should the umpires initiate the caution and warning procedures set out in clauses 41.6.1.3, 41.6.9, and 41.7, 

such cautions and warnings are not to be cumulative. 

41.7  Bowling of dangerous and unfair non-pitching deliveries 

41.7.1  Any delivery, which passes or would have passed, without pitching, above waist height of the striker 

standing upright at the popping crease, is to be deemed to be unfair, whether or not it is likely to inflict 
physical injury on the striker. If the bowler bowls such a delivery the umpire shall immediately call and signal 
No ball. 

If, in the opinion of the umpire, such a delivery is considered likely to inflict physical injury on the batsman by 
its speed and direction, it shall be considered dangerous. When the ball is dead the umpire shall caution the 
bowler, indicating that this is a first and final warning. The umpire shall also inform the other umpire, the 
captain of the fielding side and the batsmen of what has occurred. This caution shall apply to that bowler 
throughout the innings. 

41.7.2  Should there be any further instance (where a dangerous non-pitching delivery is bowled and is considered 

likely to inflict physical injury on the batsman) by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall: 

- call and signal No ball 

- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from 
bowling 

56 

 

- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. 

The bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. 

If applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the 
previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. 

Additionally the umpire shall 

- report the occurrence to the batsmen and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. 

The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is 
considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. 

41.7.3  The warning sequence in clauses 41.7.1 and 41.7.2 is independent of the warning and action sequence in 

clause 41.6. 

41.7.4 

If the umpire considers that a bowler deliberately bowled a high full-pitched delivery, deemed to be 
dangerous and unfair as defined in clause 41.7.1, then the caution and warning in clause 41.7.1 shall be 
dispensed with. The umpire shall 

- immediately call and signal No ball. 

- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from 
bowling and inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. 

The bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. 

If applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the 
previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. 

- report the occurrence to the batsmen and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. 

The umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is 
considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. 

41.8  Bowling of deliberate front-foot No ball 

If the umpire considers that the bowler has delivered a deliberate front-foot No ball, he/she shall: 

- immediately call and signal No ball. 

- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling 

- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. 

The bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. 

If applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the previous 
over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. 

- report the occurrence to the batsmen and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. 

The umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is 
considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. 

41.9  Time wasting by the fielding side 

41.9.1 

It is unfair for any fielder to waste time. 

41.9.2 

If either umpire considers that the progress of an over is unnecessarily slow, or time is being wasted in any 
other way, by the captain of the fielding side or by any other fielder, at the first instance the umpire 
concerned shall: 

- if the ball is in play, call and signal Dead ball. 

57 

 

- inform the other umpire of what has occurred. 

The bowler’s end umpire shall then: 

- warn the captain of the fielding side, indicating that this is a first and final warning. 

- inform the batsmen of what has occurred. 

41.9.3 

If either umpire considers that there is any further waste of time in that innings by any fielder, the umpire 
concerned shall: 

- if the ball is in play, call and signal Dead ball. 

- inform the other umpire of what has occurred. 

The bowler’s end umpire shall then award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side and inform the captain of the 
fielding side of the reason for this action. 

Additionally the umpire shall inform the batsmen and, as soon as is practicable, the captain of the batting 
side of what has occurred. 

If the umpires believe that the act of time wasting was deliberate or repetitive, they may lodge a report under 
the ICC Code of Conduct. In such circumstances the Captain and/or any individual members of the fielding 
team responsible for the time wasting will be charged. 

41.10  Batsman wasting time 

41.10.1  It is unfair for a batsman to waste time. In normal circumstances, the striker should always be ready to take 

strike when the bowler is ready to start his run-up. 

In addition, an incoming batsman should be in position to take guard or his partner ready to receive the next 
ball within 2 minutes of the fall of the previous wicket. 

41.10.2  Should either batsman waste time by failing to meet this requirement, or in any other way, the following 

procedure shall be adopted. At the first instance, either before the bowler starts his run-up or when the ball 
becomes dead, as appropriate, the umpire shall 

- warn both batsmen and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall apply throughout 
the innings. The umpire shall so inform each incoming batsman. 

- inform the other umpire of what has occurred. 

- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what 
has occurred. 

41.10.3  If there is any further time wasting by any batsman in that innings, the umpire shall, at the appropriate time 

while the ball is dead 

- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. 

- inform the other umpire of the reason for this action. 

- inform the other batsman, the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the 
batting side of what has occurred. 

If the umpires believe that the act of time wasting was deemed to be deliberate or repetitive, they may lodge 
a report under the ICC Code of Conduct. In such circumstances the batsman concerned will be charged. 

41.11  The protected area 

The protected area is defined as that area of the pitch contained within a rectangle bounded at each end by 
imaginary lines parallel to the popping creases and 5 ft/1.52 m in front of each, and on the sides by imaginary lines, 
one each side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps, each parallel to it and 1 ft/30.48 cm 
from it. 

58 

 

41.12  Fielder damaging the pitch 

41.12.1  It is unfair to cause deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch. A fielder will be deemed to be causing 

avoidable damage if either umpire considers that his presence on the pitch is without reasonable cause. 

41.12.2  If a fielder causes avoidable damage to the pitch, other than as in clause 41.13.1, at the first instance the 

umpire seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire. The bowler’s end 
umpire shall then 

- caution the captain of the fielding side and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall 
apply throughout the innings. 

- inform the batsmen of what has occurred. 

41.12.3  If, in that innings, there is any further instance of avoidable damage to the pitch, by any fielder, the umpire 

seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire. The bowler’s end umpire shall 
then 

- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. 

Additionally the umpire shall 

- inform the fielding captain of the reason for this action. 

- inform the batsmen and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. 

The umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is 
considered appropriate against the fielder concerned. 

41.13  Bowler running on protected area 

41.13.1  It is unfair for a bowler to enter the protected area in his follow-through without reasonable cause, whether or 

not the ball is delivered. 

41.13.2  If a bowler contravenes this clause, at the first instance and when the ball is dead, the umpire shall 

- caution the bowler and inform the other umpire of what has occurred. This caution shall apply to that 
bowler throughout the innings. 

- inform the captain of the fielding side and the batsmen of what has occurred. 

41.13.3  If, in that innings, the same bowler again contravenes this clause, the umpire shall repeat the above 
procedure indicating that this is a final warning. This warning shall also apply throughout the innings. 

41.13.4  If, in that innings, the same bowler contravenes this clause a third time, when the ball is dead, the umpire 

shall, 

- direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling. If applicable, the 
over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the previous over, nor 
be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. The bowler taken off shall not be allowed to bowl again in that 
innings. 

- inform the other umpire of the reason for this action. 

- inform the batsmen and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. 

The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is 
considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. 

41.14  Batsman damaging the pitch 

41.14.1  It is unfair to cause deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch. If the striker enters the protected area in 

playing or playing at the ball, he must move from it immediately thereafter. A batsman will be deemed to be 

59 

 

causing avoidable damage if either umpire considers that his presence on the pitch is without reasonable 
cause. 

41.14.2  If either batsman causes deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch, other than as in clause 41.15, at the 

first instance the umpire seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the 
occurrence. The bowler’s end umpire shall then 

- warn both batsmen that the practice is unfair and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning 
shall apply throughout the innings. The umpire shall so inform each incoming batsman. 

- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what 
has occurred. 

41.14.3  If there is any further instance of avoidable damage to the pitch by any batsman in that innings, the umpire 

seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the occurrence. 

The bowler’s end umpire shall 

- disallow all runs to the batting side 

- return any not out batsman to his original end 

- signal No ball or Wide to the scorers if applicable. 

- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. 

- award any other 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective 
helmets belonging to the fielding side). 

- Inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the 
reason for this action. 

The umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is 
considered appropriate against the batsman concerned. 

41.15  Striker in protected area 

41.15.1  The striker shall not adopt a stance in the protected area or so close to it that frequent encroachment is 

inevitable. 

The striker may mark a guard on the pitch provided that no mark is unreasonably close to the protected 
area. 

41.15.2  If either umpire considers that the striker is in breach of any of the conditions in clause 41.15.1, if the bowler 

has not entered the delivery stride, he/she shall immediately call Dead ball, otherwise, wait until the ball is 
dead; he/she shall then inform the other umpire of the occurrence. 

The bowler’s end umpire shall then: 

- warn the striker that the practice is unfair and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning 
shall apply throughout the innings. The umpire shall so inform the non-striker and each incoming batsman. 

- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what 
has occurred. 

41.15.3  If there is any further breach of any of the conditions in clause 41.15.1 by any batsman in that innings, the 

umpire seeing the contravention shall, if the bowler has not entered his delivery stride, immediately call and 
signal Dead ball, otherwise, he/she shall wait until the ball is dead and then inform the other umpire of the 
occurrence. 

The bowler’s end umpire shall 

- disallow all runs to the batting side 

60 

 

- return any not out batsman to his original end 

- signal No ball or Wide to the scorers if applicable. 

- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. 

- award any other 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective 
helmets belonging to the fielding side). 

- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the 
reason for this action. 

The umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is 
considered appropriate against the batsman concerned. 

41.16  Non-striker leaving his ground early 

If the non-striker is out of his ground from the moment the ball comes into play to the instant when the bowler would 
normally have been expected to release the ball, the bowler is permitted to attempt to run him out. Whether the 
attempt is successful or not, the ball shall not count as one in the over. 

If the bowler fails in an attempt to run out the non-striker, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball as soon as 
possible. 

41.17  Batsmen stealing a run 

41.17.1  It is unfair for the batsmen to attempt to steal a run during the bowler’s run-up. 

Unless the bowler attempts to run out either batsman – see clauses 41.16 and 21.4 (Bowler throwing 
towards striker’s end before delivery) – the umpire shall 

- call and signal Dead ball as soon as the batsmen cross in such an attempt. 

- inform the other umpire of the reason for this action. 

The bowler’s end umpire shall then 

- return the batsmen to their original ends. 

- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. 

- inform the batsmen, the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting 
side, of the reason for this action. 

The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is 
considered appropriate against the batsman concerned. 

41.18  Penalty runs 

41.18.1  When Penalty runs are awarded to either side, when the ball is dead the umpire shall signal the Penalty runs 

to the scorers. See clause 2.13 (Signals). 

41.18.2  Penalty runs shall be awarded in each case where these Playing Conditions require the award, even if a 

result has already been achieved. See clause 16.6 (Winning hit or extras). 

Note, however, that the restrictions on awarding Penalty runs, in clauses 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded), 
34.4 (Runs scored from ball lawfully struck more than once) and 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the 
fielding side), will apply. 

41.18.3  When 5 Penalty runs are awarded to the batting side under any of clauses 24.4 (Player returning without 

permission), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side) or under 41.3, 
41.4, 41.5, 41.9 or 41.12, then 

- they shall be scored as Penalty extras and shall be in addition to any other penalties. 

61 

 

- they are awarded when the ball is dead and shall not be regarded as runs scored from either the 
immediately preceding delivery or the immediately following delivery, and shall be in addition to any runs 
from those deliveries. 

- the batsmen shall not change ends solely by reason of the 5 run penalty. 

41.18.4  When 5 Penalty runs are awarded to the fielding side, under clause 18.5.2 (Deliberate short runs), or under 

41.10, 41.14, 41.15 or 41.17, they shall be added as Penalty extras to that side’s total of runs in its most 
recently completed innings. If the fielding side has not completed an innings, the 5 Penalty runs shall be 
added to the score in its next innings. 

41.19  Unfair actions 

41.19.1  If an umpire considers that any action by a player, not covered in these Playing Conditions, is unfair, he/she 
shall call and signal Dead ball, if appropriate, as soon as it becomes clear that the call will not disadvantage 
the non-offending side, and report the matter to the other umpire. 

The bowler’s end umpire shall 

41.19.1.1  If this is a first offence by that side 

- summon the offending player’s captain and issue a first and final warning which shall 
apply to all members of the team for the remainder of the match. 

- warn the offending player’s captain that any further such offence by any member of his 
team shall result in the award of 5 Penalty runs to the opposing team. 

41.19.1.2  If this is a second or subsequent offence by that side 

- award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side 

41.19.1.3 

The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such 
action as is considered appropriate against the player concerned. 

42 PLAYERS’ CONDUCT 

42.1  Serious misconduct 

42.1.1  The umpires shall act upon any serious misconduct. The relevant offences and the corresponding actions by 

the umpires are identified in clause 42.2.1. These offences correspond with Level 4 offences in the ICC 
Code of Conduct. Level 1 to Level 3 offences continue to be dealt with separately under the ICC Code of 
Conduct. 

42.1.2 

If either umpire considers that a player has committed one of these offences at any time during the match, 
the umpire concerned shall call and signal Dead ball. This call may be delayed until the umpire is satisfied 
that it will not disadvantage the non-offending side. 

42.1.3  The umpire concerned shall report the matter to the other umpire and together they shall decide whether an 

offence has been committed. The umpires may also consult with the third umpire and the match referee, 
who may review any audio or video replays to confirm whether an offence has been committed. If so, the 
umpires shall then apply the related sanctions. 

42.1.4 

If the offence is committed by a batsman, the umpires shall summon the offending player’s captain to the 
field. Solely for the purpose of this clause, the batsmen at the wicket may not deputise for their captain. 

42.2  Level 4 offences and action by umpires 

42.2.1  Any of the following actions by a player shall constitute a Level 4 offence: 

- threatening to assault an umpire 

- making inappropriate and deliberate physical contact with an umpire 

- physically assaulting a player or any other person 

62 

 

- committing any other act of violence. 

42.2.2 

If such an offence is committed, 42.2.2.1 to 42.2.2.5 shall be implemented. 

42.2.2.1  The umpire shall call Time. 

42.2.2.2  Together the umpires shall summon and inform the offending player’s captain that an offence at this Level 

has occurred. 

42.2.2.3  The umpires shall instruct the captain to remove the offending player immediately from the field of play for 

the remainder of the match and shall apply the following: 

42.2.2.3.1 

42.2.2.3.2 

42.2.2.3.3 

If the offending player is a fielder, no substitute shall be allowed for him. He is to be 
recorded as Retired – out at the commencement of any subsequent innings in which 
his team is the batting side. 

If a bowler is suspended mid-over, then that over must be completed by a different 
bowler, who shall not have bowled the previous over nor shall be permitted to bowl 
the next over. 

If the offending player is a batsman he is to be recorded as Retired – out in the 
current innings, unless he has been dismissed under any of clauses 32 to 39, and at 
the commencement of any subsequent innings in which his team is the batting side. If 
no further batsman is available to bat, the innings is completed. 

42.2.2.4  As soon as practicable, the umpire shall: 

- award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing team 

- signal the Level 4 penalty to the scorers 

- call Play. 

42.2.2.5  The umpires shall then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee under the ICC Code of Conduct. 

42.3  Captain refusing to remove a player from the field 

42.3.1 

If a captain refuses to carry out an instruction under 42.2.2.3, the umpires shall invoke clause 16.3 (Umpires 
awarding a match). 

42.3.2 

If both captains refuse to carry out instructions under 42.2.2.3 in respect of the same incident, the umpires 
shall instruct the players to leave the field. The match is not concluded as in clause 12.9 and there shall be 
no result under clause 16. 

42.4  Additional points relating to Level 4 offences 

42.4.1 

If a player, while acting as wicket-keeper, commits a Level 4 offence, clause 24.1.2 shall not apply, meaning 
that only a nominated player may keep wicket, even if another fielder becomes injured or ill and is replaced 
by a substitute. 

42.4.2  A nominated player who has a substitute will also suffer the penalty for any Level 4 offence committed by 

the substitute. However, only the substitute will be reported under clause 42.2.2.5.

The square is a specially prepared area of the field of play within which the match pitch is situated. 

3.3 

The outfield is that part of the field of play between the square and the boundary. 

4  Positioning 

4.1 

4.2 

4.3 

4.4 

Behind the popping crease at one end of the pitch is that area of the field of play, including any other 
marking, objects and persons therein, that is on that side of the popping crease that does not include the 
creases at the opposite end of the pitch.  Behind, in relation to any other marking, object or person, follows 
the same principle.  See the diagram in paragraph 13.  

In front of the popping crease at one end of the pitch is that area of the field of play, including any other 
marking, objects and persons therein, that is on that side of the popping crease that includes the creases at 
the opposite end of the pitch.  In front of, in relation to any other marking, object or person, follows the same 
principle.  See the diagram in paragraph 13. 

The striker’s end is the place where the striker stands to receive a delivery from the bowler only insofar as it 
identifies, independently of where the striker may subsequently move, one end of the pitch.  

The bowler’s end is the end from which the bowler delivers the ball.  It is the other end of the pitch from the 
striker’s end and identifies that end of the pitch that is not the striker’s end as described in paragraph 4.3.  

4.5 

The wicket-keeper’s end is the same as the striker’s end as described in paragraph 4.3. 

4.6 

4.7 

In front of the line of the striker’s wicket is in the area of the field of play in front of the imaginary line joining 
the fronts of the stumps at the striker’s end; this line to be considered extended in both directions to the 
boundary.  See paragraph 4.2. 

Behind the wicket is in the area of the field of play behind the imaginary line joining the backs of the stumps 
at the appropriate end; this line to be considered extended in both directions to the boundary. See paragraph 
4.1. 

4.8 

Behind the wicket-keeper is behind the wicket at the striker’s end, as defined above, but in line with both 
sets of stumps and further from the stumps than the wicket-keeper. 

4.9  Off side/on (leg) side – see diagram in paragraph 13 

4.10 

Inside edge is the edge on the same side as the nearer wicket.  

5  Umpires and decision-making 

5.1 

5.2 

5.3 

Umpire – where the description the umpire is used on its own, it always means ‘the bowler’s end umpire’ 
though this full description is sometimes used for emphasis or clarity.  Similarly the umpires always means 
both umpires and the third umpire.  An umpire and umpires are generalised terms.  Otherwise, a fuller 
description indicates which one of the umpires is specifically intended.  Each umpire will be bowler’s end 
umpire and striker’s end umpire in alternate overs.  

Bowler’s end umpire is the umpire who is standing at the bowler’s end (see paragraph 4.4) for the current 
delivery. 

Striker’s end umpire is the umpire who is standing at the striker’s end (see paragraph 4.3), to one side of the 
pitch or the other, depending on his/her choice, for the current delivery.     

66 

 

5.4  On-field umpires shall mean, collectively, the bowler’s end umpire and the striker’s end umpire. 

5.5 

5.6 

5.7 

5.8 

5.9 

Third umpire is the umpire who may use television evidence and other available technology in order review a 
decision of the on-field umpires, either by way of an Umpire Review or a Player Review under the protocol set 
out in Appendix D. 

Umpires together agree applies to decisions which the umpires are to make jointly, independently of the 
players. 

Decision Review System or DRS is the process covered by the Decision Review System and Third Umpire 
Protocol set out in Appendix D, under which the third umpire may be consulted in relation to a decision of the 
on-field umpires, either by way of an Umpire Review or a Player Review. 

Player Review is the process set out in Appendix D by which a player may request a review of any decision 
taken by the on-field umpires concerning whether or not a batsman is dismissed (with the exception of ‘Timed 
out’). 

Umpire Review is the process set out in Appendix D by which an on-field umpire has the discretion to refer a 
decision to the third umpire or, under certain circumstances, to consult with the third umpire before making a 
decision. 

5.10  Soft Signal is the visual communication by the bowler’s end umpire to the third umpire (accompanied by 

additional information via two-way radio where necessary) of his/her initial on-field decision prior to initiating 
an Umpire Review. 

5.11  Umpire’s Call is the concept within the DRS under which the on-field decision of the bowler’s end umpire 

shall stand, which shall apply under the specific circumstances set out in paragraphs 3.4.5 and 3.4.6 of 
Appendix D, where the ball-tracking technology indicates a marginal decision in respect of either the Impact 
Zone or the Wicket Zone. 

5.12  The Pitching Zone as used in the DRS is a two dimensional area on the pitch between both sets of stumps 
with its boundaries consisting of the base of both sets of stumps and a line between the outside of the outer 
stumps at each end. 

5.13  The Impact Zone as used in the DRS is a three dimensional space extending between both sets of stumps to 

an indefinite height vertically and with its boundaries consisting of the base of the stumps and the outside of 
the outer stumps at each end. 

5.14  The Wicket Zone as used in the DRS is a two dimensional area with its boundaries consisting of the outside 

of the outer stumps, the base of the stumps, and the lower edge of the bails. 

5.15  A Fair Catch is a catch that has been taken cleanly by the fielder in accordance with clause 33. 

5.16  A Bump Ball is where the ball has made contact with the ground shortly after making contact with the striker’s 

bat. 

5.17  The Elite Panel is the group of umpires contracted to the ICC to officiate in international cricket.  

5.18  The International Panel is the group of umpires nominated by the ICC’s full members in accordance with 

clause 2.1.3 of the Playing Conditions. 

6  Batsmen 

6.1 

Batting side is the side currently batting, whether or not play is in progress. 

6.2  Member of the batting side is one of the players nominated by the captain of the batting side, or any 

authorised replacement for such nominated player. 

6.3 

A batsman’s ground – at each end of the pitch, the whole area of the field of play behind the popping crease 
is the ground at that end for a batsman. 

6.4  Original end is the end where a batsman was when the ball came into play for that delivery. 

6.5  Wicket he has left is the wicket at the end where a batsman was at the start of the run in progress. 

6.6  Guard position is the position and posture adopted by the striker to receive a ball delivered by the bowler 

67 

 

7  Fielders 

7.1 

Fielding side is the side currently fielding, whether or not play is in progress. 

7.2  Member of the fielding side is one of the players nominated by the captain of the fielding side, or any 

authorised replacement or substitute for such nominated player.  

7.3 

Fielder is one of the 11 or fewer players who together represent the fielding side on the field of play. This 
definition includes not only both the bowler and the wicket-keeper but also nominated players who are 
legitimately on the field of play, together with players legitimately acting as substitutes for absent nominated 
players.  It excludes any nominated player who is absent from the field of play, or who has been absent from 
the field of play and who has not yet obtained the umpire’s permission to return.  

A player going briefly outside the boundary in the course of discharging his duties as a fielder is not absent 
from the field of play nor, for the purposes of clause 24.2 (Fielder absent or leaving the field of play), is he to 
be regarded as having left the field of play. 

8  Substitutes 

8.1 

A Substitute is a player who takes the place of a fielder on the field of play, but does not replace the player 
for whom he substitutes on that side’s list of nominated players.  A substitute’s activities are limited to fielding. 

9  Bowlers 

9.1  Over the wicket / round the wicket – If, as the bowler runs up between the wicket and the return crease, the 

wicket is on the same side as his bowling arm, he is bowling over the wicket.  If the return crease is on the 
same side as his bowling arm, he is bowling round the wicket. 

9.2 

Delivery swing is the motion of the bowler’s arm during which he normally releases the ball for a delivery. 

9.3 

Delivery stride is the stride during which the delivery swing is made, whether the ball is released or not.  It 
starts when the bowler’s back foot lands for that stride and ends when the front foot lands in the same stride.  
The stride after the delivery stride is completed when the next foot lands, i.e. when the back foot of the 
delivery stride lands again. 

9.4 

The Illegal Bowling Regulations are the ICC’s regulations governing Illegal Bowling Actions. 

9.5 

An Illegal Bowling Action is a bowling action where a bowler’s Elbow Extension exceeds 15 degrees, 
measured from the point at which the bowling arm reaches the horizontal until the point at which the ball is 
released (any Elbow Hyperextension shall be discounted for the purposes of determining an Illegal Bowling 
Action). 

9.6 

Elbow Extension means the motion that occurs when a bowler's arm moves from a flexed (bent) position at 
the elbow, to a more extended (straight) position (full Elbow Extension occurs when the arm is straight). 

9.7 

Elbow Hyperextension is the motion that occurs when a bowler's elbow extends beyond the straight position. 

9.8 

The ICC Bowling Action Report Form is the form provided for by Article 3 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations, 
by which an umpire and/or the ICC Match Referee may submit a report relating to a suspected Illegal Bowling 
Action. 

10 The ball 

10.1  The ball is struck/strikes the ball unless specifically defined otherwise, mean ‘the ball is struck by the 

bat’/‘strikes the ball with the bat’. 

10.2  Rebounds directly/strikes directly and similar phrases mean ‘without contact with any fielder’ but do not 

exclude contact with the ground. 

10.3  Full-pitch describes a ball delivered by the bowler that reaches or passes the striker without having touched 

the ground.  Sometimes described as non-pitching. 

68 

 

11 Runs 

11.1  A run to be disallowed is one that in these Playing Conditions should not have been taken.  It is not only to 

be cancelled but the batsmen are to be returned to their original ends.   

11.2  A run not to be scored is one that is not illegal, but is not recognised as a properly executed run.  It is not a 

run that has been made, so the question of cancellation does not arise.  The loss of the run so attempted is 
not a disallowance and the batsmen will not be returned to their original ends on that account.  

12 The person 

12.1  Person; A player’s person is his physical person (flesh and blood) together with any clothing or legitimate 

external protective equipment that he is wearing except, in the case of a batsman, his bat. 

A hand, whether gloved or not, that is not holding the bat is part of the batsman’s person. 

No item of clothing or equipment is part of the player’s person unless it is attached to him. 

For a batsman, a glove being held but not worn is part of his person. 

For a fielder, an item of clothing or equipment he is holding in his hand or hands is not part of his person. 

12.2  Clothing – anything that a player is wearing, including such items as spectacles or jewellery, that is not 

classed as external protective equipment is classed as clothing, even though he may be wearing some items 
of apparel, which are not visible, for protection.  A bat being carried by a batsman does not come within this 
definition of clothing. 

12.3  Hand for batsman or wicket-keeper shall include both the hand itself and the whole of a glove worn on the 

hand. 

13 Off side / on side; in front of / behind the popping crease.

1.2 

Specifications for the Handle 

1.2.1  One end of the handle is inserted into a recess in the blade as a means of joining the handle and the blade. 

This lower portion is used purely for joining the blade and the handle together.  It is not part of the blade but, 
solely in interpreting paragraphs 1.3 and 1.4 below, references to the blade shall be considered to extend 
also to this lower portion of the handle where relevant. 

1.2.2 

The handle may be glued where necessary and bound with twine along the upper portion.  

Providing clause 5.5 is not contravened, the upper portion may be covered with materials solely to provide a 
surface suitable for gripping.  Such covering is an addition and is not part of the bat, except in relation to 
clause 5.6.  The bottom of this grip should not extend below the point defined in paragraph 1.2.4 below. 

Twine binding and the covering grip may extend beyond the junction of the upper and lower portions of the 
handle, to cover part of the shoulders of the bat as defined in paragraph 1.3.1. 

No material may be placed on or inserted into the lower portion of the handle other than as permitted above 
together with the minimal adhesives or adhesive tape used solely for fixing these items, or for fixing the 
handle to the blade. 

1.2.3  Materials in handle – As a proportion of the total volume of the handle, materials other than cane, wood or 

twine are restricted to one-tenth. Such materials must not project more than 3.25 in/8.26 cm into the lower 
portion of the handle 

1.2.4

resulting from traditional pressing techniques.  The back is the opposite surface. 

1.3.1.2  The shoulders, sides and toe are the remaining surfaces, separating the face and the back. 

1.3.1.3  The shoulders, one on each side of the handle, are along that portion of the blade between the first 

entry point of the handle and the point at which the blade first reaches its full width. 

1.3.1.4  The toe is the surface opposite to the shoulders taken as a pair. 

1.3.1.5  The sides, one each side of the blade, are along the rest of the blade, between the toe and the 

shoulders. 

70 

 

1.3.2 

No material may be placed on or inserted into the blade other than as permitted in paragraph 1.2.4, 
paragraph 1.3.3, and clause 5.4 together with the minimal adhesives or adhesive tape used solely for fixing 
these items, or for fixing the handle to the blade. 

1.3.3 

Covering the blade. Bats shall have no covering on the blade except as permitted in clause 5.4.   

Any materials referred to above, in clause 5.4 and paragraph 1.4 below, are to be considered as part of the

1.4 

Protection and repair  

1.4.1 

The surface of the blade may be treated with non-solid materials to improve resistance to moisture 
penetration and/or mask natural blemishes in the appearance of the wood.  Save for the purpose of giving a 
homogeneous appearance by masking natural blemishes, such treatment shall not materially alter the colour 
of the blade.  

1.4.2  Materials can be used for protection and repair as stated in clause 5.4 and are additional to the blade. Note 

however clause 5.6. 

Any such material shall not extend over any part of the back of the blade except in the case of clause 5.4.1 
and then only when it is applied as a continuous wrapping covering the damaged area. 

The repair material shall not extend along the length of the blade more than 0.79 in/2.0 cm in each direction 
beyond the limits of the damaged area.  Where used as a continuous binding, any overlapping shall not 
breach the maximum of 0.04 in/0.1 cm in total thickness. 

The use of non-solid material which when dry forms a hard layer more than 0.004 in/0.01 cm in thickness is 
not permitted. 

1.4.3 

Permitted coverings, repair material and toe guards, not exceeding their specified thicknesses, may be 
additional to the dimensions above, but the bat must still pass through the gauge as described in paragraph

ICC Technical 
Officer 

Not required. 

The ICC shall appoint an independent 
technology expert (ICC Technical Officer) to 
be present at every series in which the DRS 
is used to assist the third umpire and to 
protect the integrity of the DRS process. 

The Home Board shall ensure that a separate room is provided for the third umpire and that he/she has 
access to the television equipment and technology (where DRS is used) so as to be in the best position to 
facilitate the referral and/or consultation processes referred to in paragraphs 2 (Umpire Review) and 3 
(Player Review) below. 

2  Umpire Review 

In the circumstances detailed in paragraphs 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 below, the on-field umpire shall have the 
discretion to refer the decision to the third umpire or, in the case of paragraphs 2.2, and 2.4, to consult with 
the third umpire before making the decision. 

Save for requesting the umpire to review his/her decision under paragraph 3 (Player Review) below, players 
may not appeal to the on-field umpires to use the Umpire Review. Breach of this provision may constitute 
dissent and the player may be subject to disciplinary action under the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and 
Player Support Personnel. 

2.1 

Run Out, Stumped, Bowled and Hit Wicket Decisions 

2.1.1 

2.1.2 

2.1.3 

2.1.4 

2.1.5 

The relevant on-field umpire shall be entitled to refer an appeal for run-out, stumped, bowled or hit wicket to 
the third umpire. 

An on-field umpire wishing to refer a decision to the third umpire shall signal to the third umpire by making 
the shape of a TV screen with his/her hands. 

In the case of a referral of a bowled, hit wicket or stumped decision, the third umpire shall first check the 
fairness of the delivery (all modes of No ball except for the bowler using an Illegal Bowling Action, subject to 
the proviso that the third umpire may review whether the bowler has used a prohibited Specific Variation 
under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations). If the delivery was not a fair delivery the third umpire 
shall indicate that the batsman is Not out and advise the on-field umpire to signal No ball. See also 
paragraph 2.5 below. 

Additionally, if the third umpire finds the batsman is Out by another mode of dismissal (excluding LBW), or 
Not out by any mode of dismissal (excluding LBW), he/she shall notify the on-field umpire so that the correct 
decision is made. 

If the third umpire decides that the batsman is Out, a red light shall be displayed; if the third umpire decides 
that the batsman is Not out, a green light shall be displayed. Should the third umpire be temporarily unable 
to respond, a white light (where available) shall remain illuminated throughout the period of interruption to 
signify to the on-field umpires that Umpire Reviews are temporarily unavailable, in which case the decision 
shall be taken by the on-field umpire. As an alternative to the red/green light system, the replay screen 

77 

 

(where available) may be used for the purpose of conveying the third umpire’s decision, in line with the ICC 
Big Screen Policy. 

2.2 

Caught Decisions, Obstructing the Field 

2.2.1  Where the bowler’s end umpire is unable to decide upon a Fair Catch or a Bump Ball, or if, on appeal from 

the fielding side, the batsman obstructed the field, he/she shall first consult with the striker’s end umpire. 

2.2.2 

2.2.3 

Should both on-field umpires require assistance from the third umpire to make a decision, the bowler’s end 
umpire shall firstly take a decision on-field after consulting with the striker’s end umpire, before consulting by 
two-way radio with the third umpire. Such consultation shall be initiated by the bowler’s end umpire to the 
third umpire by making the shape of a TV screen with his/her hands, followed by a Soft Signal of Out or Not 
out made with the hands close to the chest at chest height. If the third umpire advises that the replay 
evidence is inconclusive, the on-field decision communicated at the start of the consultation process shall 
stand. 

The third umpire shall determine whether the batsman has been caught, whether the delivery was a Bump 
Ball, or if the batsman obstructed the field. However, in reviewing the television replay(s), the third umpire 
shall first check the fairness of the delivery for all decisions involving a catch (all modes of No ball except for 
the bowler using an Illegal Bowling Action, subject to the proviso that the third umpire may review whether 
the bowler has used a prohibited Specific Variation under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations) and 
whether the batsman has hit the ball. If the delivery was not a fair delivery or if it is clear to the third umpire 
that the batsman did not hit the ball he/she shall indicate to the bowler’s end umpire that the batsman is Not 
out caught, and in the case of an unfair delivery, advise the bowler’s end umpire to signal No ball. See also 
paragraph 2.5 below. Additionally, if it is clear to the third umpire that the batsman is Out by another mode of 
dismissal (excluding LBW), or Not out by any mode of dismissal (excluding LBW), he/she shall notify the 
bowler’s end umpire so that the correct decision can be made. 

2.2.4 

The third umpire shall communicate his/her decision as set out in paragraph 2.1.5. 

2.3 

Boundary Decisions 

2.3.1 

The bowler’s end umpire shall be entitled to refer to the third umpire for a decision on: 

2.3.1.1  whether a four or six has been scored; 

2.3.1.2  whether a fielder had any part of his person in contact with the ball when he touched the boundary; 

or 

2.3.1.3  whether the fielder had any part of his person in contact with the ball when he had any part of his 

person grounded beyond the boundary. 

2.3.2 

A decision shall be made immediately and cannot be changed thereafter. 

2.3.3 

If the television evidence is inconclusive as to whether or not a boundary has been scored, the default 
presumption shall be in favour of no boundary being awarded. 

2.3.4  Where the bowler’s end umpire wishes to use the assistance of the third umpire in this circumstance, he/she 
shall communicate with the third umpire by use of a two-way radio and the third umpire shall convey his/her 
decision to the bowler’s end umpire by the same method. 

2.3.5 

The third umpire may initiate contact with the on-field umpire by two-way radio if TV coverage shows a 
boundary line infringement or incident that appears not to have been acted upon by the on-field umpires. 

2.4 

Batsmen Running to the Same End 

2.4.1  Where both batsmen have run to the same end and the on-field umpires are uncertain over which batsman 

made his ground first, the on-field umpires may consult with the third umpire. 

2.4.2 

The procedure set out in paragraph 2.3.4 shall apply. 

78 

 

2.5 

No Balls 

2.5.1 

2.5.2 

2.5.3 

2.5.4 

If the bowler’s end umpire is uncertain as to the fairness of the delivery following a dismissal, either affecting 
the validity of the dismissal or which batsman is dismissed, he/she shall be entitled to request the batsman 
to delay leaving the field and to check the fairness of the delivery with the third umpire. Communication with 
the third umpire shall be by two-way radio. 

The third umpire shall check all modes of No ball except for the bowler using an Illegal Bowling Action 
(subject to the proviso that the third umpire may review whether the bowler has used a prohibited Specific 
Variation under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations). The third umpire shall apply clause 21.5 when 
deciding whether a No ball should have been called (and must therefore be satisfied that none of the three 
conditions in clause 21.5 have been met before calling a No ball). 

If the delivery was not a fair delivery, the bowler’s end umpire shall indicate that the batsman is Not out and 
signal No ball (except in the case of a dismissal for obstructing the field, which may still be effected despite a 
No ball being called, in which case the bowler’s end umpire shall indicate that the relevant batsman is Out 
and additionally call a No ball). 

If a No ball is called following the check by the third umpire, the batting side shall benefit from the reversal of 
the dismissal and the one run for the No ball, but shall not benefit from any runs that may subsequently have 
accrued from the delivery had the on-field umpire originally called a No ball. Where the batsmen crossed 
while the ball was in the air before being caught, the batsmen shall remain at the same ends as if the striker 
had been dismissed, but no runs shall be credited to the striker even if one (or more) runs were completed 
prior to the catch being taken. 

2.6 

Cameras On or Over the Field of Play 

2.6.1 

The on-field umpires shall be entitled to refer to the third umpire for a decision as to whether the ball has at 
any time during the normal course of play come into contact with any part of the camera, its apparatus or its 
cables above the playing area, as contemplated in clause 20.1.3. 

2.6.2  Where an on-field umpire wishes to use the assistance of the third umpire in this circumstance, he/she shall 

communicate with the third umpire by use of a two-way radio and the third umpire shall convey his/her 
decision to the bowler’s end umpire by the same method. 

2.6.3 

A decision shall be made immediately and cannot be changed thereafter. If the television evidence is 
inconclusive as to whether or not the ball has come into contact with any part of the camera, its apparatus or 
its cables above the playing area, the default presumption shall be in favour of no contact having been 
made. 

2.6.4 

The third umpire may initiate contact with the on-field umpire by two-way radio if TV coverage shows the ball 
to have been in contact with any part of the camera or its cables above the playing area as envisaged under 
this paragraph. 

3  Player Review 

The following paragraphs shall operate in addition to and in conjunction with paragraph 2 (Umpire Review). 

3.1 

Circumstances in which a Player Review may be requested 

3.1.1 

3.1.2 

A player may request a review of any decision taken by the on-field umpires concerning whether or not a 
batsman is dismissed, with the exception of ‘Timed Out’ (Player Review). 

No other decisions made by the umpires are eligible for a Player Review with the exception of Fair 
Catch/Bump Ball (even after the third umpire has been consulted and the decision communicated). 

3.1.3  Only the batsman involved in a dismissal may request a Player Review of an Out decision and only the 

captain (or acting captain) of the fielding team may request a Player Review of a Not out decision. 

3.1.4 

A decision concerning whether or not a batsman is dismissed that could have been the subject of a Umpire 
Review under paragraph 2 is eligible for a Player Review as soon as it is clear that the on-field umpire has 
chosen not to initiate the Umpire Review. 

79 

 

3.2 

The manner of requesting the Player Review 

3.2.1 

The request shall be made by the player making a ‘T’ sign with both forearms at head height. 

3.2.2 

3.2.3 

3.2.4 

The total time elapsed between the ball becoming dead and the review request being made shall be no 
more than 15 seconds. The only exception permitted shall be when an Umpire Review for Fair Catch or 
Bump Ball (as permitted in paragraph 2.2 above) is required to answer an appeal for a caught decision, in 
which case either team is able to request a Player Review of that caught decision within 15 seconds of the 
decision being communicated. The bowler’s end umpire shall provide the relevant player with a prompt after 
10 seconds if the request has not been made at that time and the player shall request the review 
immediately thereafter. If the on-field umpires believe that a request has not been made within the 15 
second time limit, they shall decline the request for a Player Review. 

The captain may consult with the bowler and other fielders, and the two batsmen may consult with each 
other prior to deciding whether to request a Player Review. Under no circumstances is any player permitted 
to query an umpire about any aspect of a decision before deciding on whether or not to request a Player 
Review. If the on-field umpires believe that the captain or either batsman has received direct or indirect input 
emanating other than from the players on the field, then they may at their discretion decline the request for a 
Player Review. In particular, signals from the dressing room must not be given. 

No replays, either at normal speed or slow motion, shall be shown on a big screen to spectators until the 15 
second time limit allowed for requesting a Player Review has elapsed. The only exception to this provision is 
where a Player Review of a caught decision is requested after the Umpire Review of a Fair Catch or Bump 
Ball has concluded, as detailed in paragraph 3.2.2 above (due to the fact that replays may have been shown 
on the big screen during that Umpire Review process). 

3.2.5  Where either on-field umpire initiates an Umpire Review, this does not preclude a player seeking a Player 
Review of a separate incident from the same delivery. The request for a Player Review may be made after 
the Umpire Review, provided the request is still within the 15 second time limit described in paragraph 3.2.2 
above. (See paragraphs 3.9.2 and 3.9.3 below for the process for addressing both an Umpire and Player 
Review). 

3.2.6 

A request for a Player Review cannot be withdrawn once it has been made. 

3.3 

The process of consultation 

3.3.1  On receipt of an eligible and timely request for a Player Review, the relevant on-field umpire shall make the 

sign of a shape of a TV screen with his/her hands in the normal way. 

3.3.2 

The relevant on-field umpire shall initiate communication with the third umpire by confirming; 

3.3.2.1  That a Player Review has been requested, 

3.3.2.2  The mode of dismissal for which the relevant on-field umpire adjudicated the appeal, 

3.3.2.3  The decision that has been made (Out or Not out), and; 

3.3.2.4  For LBW appeals, where relevant, if the bowler’s end umpire believed that the striker made no 
genuine attempt to play the ball with the bat (the default presumption of the third umpire in the 
absence of any information on this point from the bowler’s end umpire shall be that a genuine 
attempt to play the ball with the bat was made). 

3.3.3 

3.3.4 

A two-way consultation process shall begin to investigate whether there is anything that the third umpire can 
see or hear which would indicate that the on-field umpire should change his/her original decision. 

The third umpire shall not withhold any factual information which may help in the decision making process. 
In particular, in reviewing a dismissal, if the third umpire believes that the batsman may instead be Out by 
any other mode of dismissal, he/she shall advise the on-field umpire accordingly. The process of 
consultation described in this paragraph in respect of such other mode of dismissal shall then be conducted 
as if the batsman has been given Not out. 

3.3.5 

The third umpire shall initially check all modes of No ball except for the bowler using an Illegal Bowling 
Action (subject to the proviso that the third umpire may review whether the bowler has used a prohibited 

80 

 

3.3.6 

3.3.7 

Specific Variation under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations), where appropriate advising the on-
field umpire accordingly. 

If despite the available technology, the third umpire is unable to decide with a high degree of confidence 
whether the original on-field decision should be changed, then he/she shall report that the replays are 
‘inconclusive’, and that the on-field decision shall stand. The third umpire shall not give answers conveying 
likelihoods or probabilities. 

In circumstances where the television technology (all or parts thereof) is not available to the third umpire or 
fails for whatever reason, the third umpire shall advise the on-field umpire of this fact but still provide any 
relevant factual information that may be ascertained from the available television replays and other 
technology. 

3.3.8 

The on-field umpire shall then make his/her decision based on the information provided by the third umpire, 
any other factual information offered by the third umpire and his/her recollection and opinion of the original 
incident. 

3.3.9 

The on-field umpire shall reverse his/her decision if the nature of the supplementary information received 
from the third umpire leads him/her to conclude that his/her original decision was incorrect. 

3.4 

Review of LBW Decisions 

3.4.1 

In assessing whether a batsman is Out LBW in accordance with clause 36, the third umpire shall first judge 
whether the delivery is fair (as set out in clause 36.1.1), and second, whether or not the ball has touched the 
bat before being intercepted by any part of the striker’s person (as set out in clause 36.1.3). 

3.4.2 

If the batsman is still eligible to be Out, the ball-tracking technology shall then present three pieces of 
information to the third umpire relating to the path of the ball: 

3.4.2.1  The point of pitching (where applicable) (PITCHING) 

3.4.2.2  The position of the ball at the point of first interception (IMPACT) 

3.4.2.3  Whether the ball would have hit the wicket (WICKET) 

3.4.3 

This Decision Review System (DRS) and Third Umpire Protocol includes a category of Umpire’s Call, which 
shall be the conclusion reported where the technology indicates a marginal decision in respect of either the 
point of first interception or whether the ball would have hit the stumps. 

3.4.4 

PITCHING 

3.4.4.1  The interpretation of “pitches in line between wicket and wicket” in clause 36.1.2 shall refer to the 

position of the centre of the ball at the point of pitching, in relation to the Pitching Zone. 

3.4.4.2  The Pitching Zone is defined as a two dimensional area on the pitch between both sets of stumps 
with its boundaries consisting of the base of both sets of stumps and a line between the outside of 
the outer stumps at each end. 

3.4.4.3  Where applicable, the ball-tracking technology shall report that the ball pitched in one of the 

following three areas in relation to the Pitching Zone: 

In Line 

The centre of the ball was inside the Pitching Zone 

Outside Off 

The centre of the ball was outside, and to the off side of, the Pitching Zone 

Outside Leg 

The centre of the ball was outside, and to the leg side of, the Pitching Zone 

 

3.4.4.4  Subject to the satisfaction of the other elements of clause 36, the batsman can be Out if the ball-
tracking technology reports that the ball pitched Outside Off or In Line, but the batsman shall be 
Not out if the ball pitched Outside Leg. 

3.4.5 

IMPACT 

81 

 

 

3.4.5.1  The interpretation of “the (first) point of impact, even if in above the level of the bails, is between 

wicket and wicket” in clause 36.1.4 shall refer to the position of the ball at the point of first 
interception, in relation to the Impact Zone. 

3.4.5.2  The Impact Zone is defined as a three dimensional space extending between both wickets to an 

indefinite height and with its boundaries consisting of a line between the outside of the outer 
stumps at each end. 

3.4.5.3  The ball-tracking technology shall report that the point of first interception was in one of the 

following categories in relation to the Impact Zone: 

In Line 

The centre of the ball was inside the Impact Zone 

Umpire’s Call 

Outside 

Some part of the ball was inside the Impact Zone, but the centre of the ball 
was outside the Impact Zone, with the further sub-category of ‘Umpire’s Call 
(off side)’ where the centre of the ball was to the off side of the Impact Zone 
and the bowler’s end umpire communicates to the third umpire that no genuine 
attempt to play the ball was made by the batsman. 

No part of the ball was inside the Impact Zone, with the further sub-categories 
of ‘Outside (off)’ and ‘Outside (leg)’ to indicate the location of the point of first 
interception in relation to the Impact Zone when the bowler’s end umpire 
communicates to the third umpire that no genuine attempt to play the ball was 
made by the batsman. 

3.4.5.4  Where a Not out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batsman has made a genuine 

attempt to play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of first interception 
was In Line for the batsman to be eligible to be given Out, otherwise the batsman shall remain Not 
out. 

3.4.5.5  Where a Not out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batsman has made no 

genuine attempt to play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of impact 
was In Line, or Umpire’s Call (off side), or Outside (off) for the batsman to be eligible to be given 
Out, otherwise the batsman shall remain Not out. 

3.4.5.6  Where an Out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batsman has made a genuine 
attempt to play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of first interception 
was Outside for the decision to be reversed to Not out, otherwise the batsman shall remain eligible 
to be given Out. 

3.4.5.7  Where an Out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batsman has made no genuine 
attempt to play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of first interception 
was Outside (leg) for the decision to be reversed to Not out, otherwise the batsman shall remain 
eligible to be given Out. 

3.4.6  WICKET 

3.4.6.1  The interpretation of whether “the ball would have hit the wicket” in clause 36.1.5 shall refer to 

position of the ball as it either hits or passes the wicket, in relation to the Wicket Zone. 

3.4.6.2  The Wicket Zone is defined as a two dimensional area whose boundaries are the outside of the 

outer stumps, the base of the stumps and the bottom of the bails. 

3.4.6.3  The ball-tracking technology shall report whether the ball would have hit the wicket with reference 

to the following three categories: 

Hitting 

The ball was hitting the wicket, and the centre of the ball was inside the 
Wicket Zone 

Umpire’s Call 

The ball was hitting the wicket, but the centre of the ball was not inside the 
Wicket Zone 

82 

 

 

Missing 

The ball was missing the wicket 

3.4.6.4  Where a Not out decision is being reviewed, the ball-tracking technology must report that the ball 
was Hitting for the batsman to be eligible to be given Out, otherwise the batsman shall remain Not 
out. 

However, where the evidence shows that the ball was Hitting, the point of first interception was In 
Line, and the ball pitched In Line or Outside Off, but that: 

• 

• 

The point of first interception was 300cm or more from the stumps; or 

The point of first interception was more than 250cm but less than 300cm from the stumps 
and the distance between the point of pitching and the point of first interception was less 
than 40cm, 

the on-field decision shall stand (that is, Not out). 

3.4.6.5  Where an Out decision is being reviewed, the ball-tracking technology must report that the ball was 

Missing for the on-field decision to be reversed to Not out, otherwise the batsman shall remain 
eligible to be given Out. 

3.4.7  When the ball strikes the batsman on the full, and the evidence provided by the ball-tracking technology 

indicates that the ball would have pitched before striking or passing the wicket, there will be no information 
available from that delivery that will allow the ball-tracking technology to accurately predict the height of the 
ball after pitching. 

3.4.8  With regard to determining whether the ball would have hit the wicket under these circumstances, the ball-

tracking technology shall project the line of the ball in accordance with clause 36.2.3 (it is to be assumed 
that the path of the ball before interception would have continued after interception, irrespective of whether 
the ball might have pitched subsequently or not), and display the simulated path of the ball from directly 
above the wicket. 

3.4.9 

The third umpire shall advise the bowler’s end umpire only on the point of first interception and whether the 
ball would have hit the stumps (in line with the process set out in paragraph 3.4 above), but shall make no 
comment on the predicted height of the ball after pitching, which shall remain a judgment of the bowler’s end 
umpire. 

3.5 

The process for communicating the final decision 

3.5.1 

For Player Reviews concerning potential dismissals, the relevant on-field umpire shall indicate Out by raising 
his/her finger above his/her head in a normal yet prominent manner or indicate Not out by the call of ‘not out’ 
and by crossing his/her hands in a horizontal position side to side in front and above his/her waist three 
times. Where the decision is a reversal of the on-field umpire’s previous decision, he/she shall make the 
‘revoke last signal’ indication immediately prior to the above. 

3.5.2 

If the mode of dismissal is not obvious or not the same as that on which the original decision was based, 
then the umpire shall advise the scorers via the third umpire. 

3.6 

Number of Player Review requests permitted 

3.6.1 

In each innings, each team shall be allowed to make a maximum of two Player Review requests that are 
categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ (as set out in paragraph 3.6.3 below). 

3.6.2  Where a request for a Player Review results in the original on-field decision being reversed, then the Player 

Review shall be categorised as ‘Successful’ and shall not count towards the innings limit. 

3.6.3  Where a request for a Player Review results in the original on-field decision remaining unchanged (other 

than in the circumstances set out in paragraphs 3.6.4, 3.6.6 or 3.6.8), the Player Review shall be 
categorised as ’Unsuccessful’. 

83 

 

3.6.4  Where a request for a Player Review of an LBW decision results in the on-field decision remaining 

unchanged solely on the basis of an Umpire’s Call, the Player Review shall be categorised as ‘Unchanged – 
Umpire’s Call’. A Player Review categorised as ‘Unchanged – Umpire’s Call’ shall not count towards the 
innings limit set out in paragraph 3.6.1. 

3.6.5  Where, following a request for a Player Review, the original on-field decision of Out is unchanged, but for a 

different mode of dismissal from the original on-field decision, then the Player Review shall still be 
categorised as ’Unsuccessful’. 

3.6.6  Where, following a request for a Player Review, the original on-field decision of Not out is unchanged on 
account of the delivery being a No ball (for any reason), thereby not requiring any further evaluation, the 
Player Review shall not be counted as ‘Unsuccessful’ and accordingly shall not count towards the innings 
limit set out in paragraph 3.6.1. 

3.6.7  Where a Player Review and an Umpire Review are requested from the same delivery and the decision of 

the third umpire from the Umpire Review renders the Player Review unnecessary (see paragraphs 3.9.2 and 
3.9.3), the Player Review request shall be disregarded and accordingly shall not count towards the innings 
limit set out in paragraph 3.6.1. 

3.6.8 

A Player Review categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ may be reinstated by the ICC Match Referee at his/her sole 
discretion (if appropriate after consultation with the ICC Technical Official and/or the television broadcast 
director) if the Player Review could not properly be concluded due to a failure of the technology. Any such 
decision shall be final and shall be taken as soon as possible, being communicated to both teams once all 
the relevant facts have been ascertained by the ICC Match Referee. A Player Review categorised as 
‘Unsuccessful’ shall not be reinstated if, despite any technical failures, the correct decision could still have 
been made using the other available technology. Similarly, a Player Review categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ 
shall not be reinstated where the technology worked as intended, but the evidence gleaned from its use was 
inconclusive. 

3.6.9 

The third umpire shall be responsible for counting the number Player Reviews categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ 
and shall advise the on-field umpires once either team has exhausted their allowance for the innings. 

3.6.10  The scoreboard shall display, for the innings in progress, the number of Player Reviews remaining available 

to each team.

3.7 

Dead ball 

3.7.1 

If following a Player Review request, an original decision of Out is changed to Not out, then the ball is still 
deemed to have become dead when the original decision was made (as per clause 20.1.1.3). The batting 
side, while benefiting from the reversal of the dismissal, shall not benefit from any runs that may 
subsequently have accrued from the delivery had the on-field umpire originally made a Not out decision, 
other than any No ball penalty that could arise under paragraph 3.3.5 above. 

84 

 

3.7.2 

If an original decision of Not out is changed to Out, the ball shall retrospectively be deemed to have become 
dead from the moment of the dismissal event. All subsequent events, including any runs scored, shall be 
ignored. 

3.8 

Use of technology 

3.8.1 

The following technology may be used by the third umpire during a Player Review: 

3.8.1.1  Replays, at any speed, from any available broadcast camera 

3.8.1.2  Sound from the stump microphones with the replays at normal speed and slow motion 

3.8.1.3  Approved ball-tracking technology:  

• 

• 

HawkEye (HawkEye Innovations), or; 

VirtualEye (ARL) 

3.8.1.4  Approved sound-based edge detection technology: 

• 

• 

Real-Time Snickometer (BBG Sports), or; 

UltraEdge (HawkEye Innovations) 

3.8.1.5  Approved heat-based edge detection technology: 

• 

Hot Spot cameras (BBG Sports) 

3.8.1.6  LED Wickets (using the lights to indicate if the wicket is broken, as set out in paragraph 4.2): 

• 

Zing Bails and Stumps 

3.8.2 

In addition, other forms of technology may be used subject to the ICC being satisfied that the required 
standards of accuracy and time efficiency can be met. 

3.8.3  Where practical usage or further testing indicates that any of the above forms of technology cannot reliably 

provide accurate and timely information, then it may be removed prior to or during a match. The final 
decision regarding the technology to be used in a given match shall be taken by the ICC Match Referee in 
consultation with the ICC Technical Official, ICC management and the competing teams’ governing bodies. 

3.9 

Combining Umpire Review with Player Review 

3.9.1 

If an Umpire Review (under paragraph 2) and a request for a Player Review (under paragraph 3) are made 
following the same delivery but relating to separate modes of dismissal, the following process shall apply. 

3.9.2 

The Umpire Review shall be carried out prior to the Player Review if all of the following conditions apply: 

3.9.2.1  The Player Review has been requested by the fielding side 

3.9.2.2  The Umpire Review and the Player Review both relate to the dismissal of the same batsman 

3.9.2.3 

If the batsman is out, the number of runs scored from the delivery would be the same for both 
modes of dismissal 

3.9.2.4 

If the batsman is out, the batsman on strike for the next delivery would be the same for both modes 
of dismissal. 

3.9.3 

If the Umpire Review leads the third umpire to make a decision of Out, then this shall be displayed in the 
usual manner and the Player Review shall not be undertaken. If the Umpire Review results in a Not out 
decision, then the third umpire shall make no public decision but shall proceed to address the request for a 
Player Review. 

3.9.4 

For illustration, following an LBW appeal which is given Not out by the bowler’s end umpire, the striker sets 
off for a run, is sent back and there is an appeal for his run out. The players request that the LBW decision is 
reviewed and the umpires request that the run out be reviewed. The four criteria above are satisfied, so the 

85 

 

run out referral is determined first. Should the appeal for run out be Out, then there is no requirement for the 
LBW review to take place. 

3.9.5 

In all other circumstances, the incidents shall be addressed in chronological order. If the conclusion from the 
first incident is that a batsman is dismissed, then the ball would be deemed to have become dead at that 
point, rendering investigation of the second incident unnecessary. 

Interpretation of Playing Conditions 

When using a replay to determine the moment at which the wicket has been put down (as per clause 29.1), 
the third umpire shall deem this to be the first frame in which one of the bails is shown (or can be deduced) 
to have lost all contact with the top of the stumps and subsequent frames show the bail permanently 
removed from the top of the stumps. 

Where LED Wickets are used (as provided for in paragraph 3.8.1.6) the moment at which the wicket has 
been put down (as per clause 29.1) shall be deemed to be the first frame in which the LED lights are 
illuminated and subsequent frames show the bail permanently removed from the top of the stumps.

Calculations 

Calculation Template for Last Day of Test Match  

This template applies to any interruption on the last day which causes a loss in actual playing time, (i.e. an 
interruption longer than the amount of extra time available) and where play resumes after the scheduled tea interval.   

Where play resumes prior to tea, then the calculation of overs remaining in the day is performed as per Days 1-4, 
with the scheduled time for the last hour affected only by the adding of any extra time. Lines A, B, C, D and E should 
be completed at the start of an interruption on the final day.  

If play resumes without any lost playing time, or prior to the tea interval, then this sheet can be discarded.  

Once the length of interruption exceeds D and actual playing time is lost, then line F can be completed Lines G and H 
can be completed immediately if the interruption starts after tea, otherwise as soon as the interruption includes the 
tea interval.

L Overs lost @ 4 mins per over (see Note 2) 

M Minimum overs before start of last hour (B – L) (See Note 1)  
The last hour then starts at the later of the time in Line F and 
the completion of the overs in Line M  

Case B: If J is not earlier than I, play resumes in the last hour 

 

 

___________ 

K Time for last hour to finish (I plus 60 minutes)  

___________ 

L Minutes remaining in last hour (K – J) 

___________ 

M Overs remaining in last hour (L / 4 mins or part thereof) 
(see Note 1) 

___________  

 

Note 1: If an interruption occurs part-way through an over, in Row B enter the number of full overs remaining, ignoring 
the part over. Then in Row M, add back the part over to the minimum overs to be bowled on resumption.  

Note 2: The actual overs lost for a given interruption will also reflect any earlier interruptions in the day, so that one 
over is lost in the day for each full four minutes of aggregated playing time lost. For example, 15 minutes loses 3 
overs, but another 15 minute delay loses 4 overs.
