match is strictly in accordance with these playing conditions. \\n\\n2.5.2 \\n\\nthe implements used in the match conform to the following \\n\\n2.5.2.1 \\n\\nclause 4 (the ball). \\n\\n2.5.2.2 \\n\\nexternally visible requirements of clause 5 (the bat) and paragraph 1 of appendix b. \\n\\n2.5.2.3 \\n\\neither clauses 8.2 (size of stumps) and 8.3 (the bails). \\n\\n2.5.3 \\n\\nno player uses equipment other than that permitted. see paragraph 2 of appendix a. note particularly \\ntherein the interpretation of ‘protective helmet’. \\n\\n2.5.4 \\n\\nthe wicket-keeper’s gloves comply with the requirements of clause 27.2 (gloves). \\n\\n2.6 \\n\\nfair and unfair play \\n\\nthe umpires shall be the sole judges of fair and unfair play. \\n\\n2.7 \\n\\nfitness for play \\n\\n2.7.1 \\n\\nit is solely for the umpires together to decide whether either conditions of ground, weather or light or \\nexceptional circumstances mean that it would be dangerous or unreasonable for play to take place. \\n\\n3 \\n\\n\\x0cconditions shall not be regarded as either dangerous or unreasonable merely because they are not ideal. \\n\\nthe fact that the grass and the ball are wet does not warrant the ground conditions being regarded as \\nunreasonable or dangerous. \\n\\nconditions shall be regarded as dangerous if there is actual and foreseeable risk to the safety of any player \\nor umpire. \\n\\nconditions shall be regarded as unreasonable if, although posing no risk to safety, it would not be sensible \\nfor play to proceed. \\n\\nif the umpires consider the ground is so wet or slippery as to deprive the bowler of a reasonable foothold, \\nthe fielders of the power of free movement, or the batsmen of the ability to play their strokes or to run \\nbetween the wickets, then these conditions shall be regarded as so bad that it would be dangerous and \\nunreasonable for play to take place. \\n\\n2.7.2 \\n\\n2.7.3 \\n\\n2.7.4 \\n\\n2.8 \\n\\nsuspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable circumstances \\n\\n2.8.1 \\n\\nall references to ground include the pitch. see clause 6.1 (area of pitch). \\n\\n2.8.2 \\n\\n2.8.3 \\n\\nif at any time the umpires together agree that the conditions of ground, weather or light, or any other \\ncircumstances are dangerous or unreasonable, they shall immediately suspend play, or not allow play to \\nstart or to recommence. the decision as to whether conditions are so bad as to warrant such action is one \\nfor the umpires alone to make, following consultation with the icc match referee. \\n\\nif circumstances are warranted, the umpires shall stop play and instruct the ground authority to take \\nwhatever action they can and use whatever equipment is necessary to remove as much dew as possible \\nfrom the outfield when conditions become unreasonable or dangerous. the umpires may also instruct the \\nground staff to take such action during scheduled and unscheduled breaks in play. \\n\\n2.8.4 \\n\\nthe umpires shall disregard any shadow on the pitch from the stadium or from any permanent object on the \\nground. \\n\\n2.8.5 \\n\\nlight meters \\n\\nit is the responsibility of the icc to supply light meters to the match officials to be used in accordance with \\nthese playing conditions. \\n\\n2.8.5.1 \\n\\nall light meters shall be uniformly calibrated. \\n\\n2.8.5.2 \\n\\nthe umpires shall be entitled to use light meter readings as a guideline for determining whether \\nthe light is fit for play in accordance with the criteria set out in clause 2.8.2 above. \\n\\n2.8.5.3 \\n\\nlight meter readings may accordingly be used by the umpires: \\n\\n2.8.5.3.1 \\n\\nto determine whether there has been at any stage a deterioration or \\nimprovement in the light. \\n\\n2.8.5.3.2 \\n\\nas benchmarks for the remainder of a match. \\n\\n2.8.6 \\n\\nuse of artificial lights \\n\\nif in the opinion of the umpires, natural light is deteriorating to an unfit level, they shall authorize the ground \\nauthority to use the available artificial lighting so that the match can commence or continue in acceptable \\nconditions. \\n\\nin the event of power failure or lights malfunction, the provisions relating to the delay or interruption of play \\ndue to bad weather or light shall apply. \\n\\n2.8.7  when there is a suspension of play it is the responsibility of the umpires to monitor conditions. they shall \\n\\nmake inspections as often as appropriate, unaccompanied by any players or officials. immediately the \\numpires together agree that the conditions are no longer dangerous or unreasonable they shall call upon the \\nplayers to resume play. \\n\\n4 \\n\\n\\x0c2.8.8 \\n\\nthe safety of all persons within the ground is of paramount importance to the icc. in the event that of any \\nthreatening circumstance, whether actual or perceived (including for example weather, pitch invasions, act \\nof god, etc.), then the umpires, on the advice of the icc match referee, should suspend play and all \\nplayers and officials should immediately be asked to leave the field of play in a safe and orderly manner and \\nto relocate to a secure and safe area (depending on each particular threat) pending the satisfactory passing \\nor resolution of such threat or risk to the reasonable satisfaction of the umpires, icc match referee, the \\nhead of the relevant ground authority, the head of ground security and/or the police as the circumstances \\nmay require. \\n\\n2.8.9  where play is suspended under clause 2.8.8 above the decision to abandon or resume play shall be the \\n\\nresponsibility of the icc match referee who shall act only after consultation with the head of ground security \\nand the police. \\n\\n2.9 \\n\\nposition of umpires \\n\\nthe umpires shall stand where they can best see any act upon which their decision may be required. \\n\\nsubject to this over-riding consideration, the bowler’s end umpire shall stand in a position so as not to interfere with \\neither the bowler’s run-up or the striker’s view. \\n\\nthe striker’s end umpire may elect to stand on the off side instead of the on side of the pitch, provided he/she informs \\nthe captain of the fielding side, the striker and the other umpire. \\n\\n2.10  umpires changing ends \\n\\nshall not apply. \\n\\n2.11  disagreement and dispute \\n\\nwhere there is disagreement or dispute about any matter, the umpires together shall make the final decision. see \\nalso clause 31.6 (consultation by umpires). \\n\\n2.12  umpire’s decision \\n\\nan umpire may alter any decision provided that such alteration is made promptly. this apart, an umpire’s decision, \\nonce made, is final. \\n\\n2.13  signals \\n\\n2.13.1  the following code of signals shall be used by umpires. \\n\\n2.13.1.1 \\n\\nsignals made while the ball is in play \\n\\nno ball - by extending one arm horizontally. \\n\\nout - by raising an index finger above the head. (if not out, the umpire shall call not out.) \\n\\nwide - by extending both arms horizontally. \\n\\ndead ball - by crossing and re-crossing the wrists below the waist. \\n\\n2.13.1.2  when the ball is dead, the bowler’s end umpire shall repeat the signals in clause 2.13.1.1, with \\n\\nthe exception of the signal for out, to the scorers. \\n\\n2.13.1.3 \\n\\nthe signals listed below shall be made to the scorers only when the ball is dead. \\n\\nboundary 4 - by waving an arm from side to side finishing with the arm across the chest \\n\\nboundary 6 - by raising both arms above the head. \\n\\nbye - by raising an open hand above the head. \\n\\nfive penalty runs awarded to the batting side - by repeated tapping of one shoulder with the \\nopposite hand. \\n\\nfive penalty runs awarded to the fielding side - by placing one hand on the opposite shoulder. \\n\\n5 \\n\\n\\x0cleg bye - by touching a raised knee with the hand. \\n\\nrevoke last signal - by touching both shoulders, each with the opposite hand. \\n\\nshort run - by bending one arm upwards and touching the nearer shoulder with the tips of the \\nfingers. \\n\\nfree hit – after signaling the no ball, the bowler’s end umpire extends one arm straight upwards \\nand moves it in a circular motion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\npowerplay over – by rotating his arm in a large circle. \\n\\nthe following signal is for level 4 player conduct offences. the signal has two parts, both of which \\nshould be acknowledged separately by the scorers. \\n\\nlevel 4 conduct \\n\\npart 1 - by putting one arm out to the side of the body and repeatedly \\nraising it and lowering it. \\n\\npart 2 - by raising an index finger, held at shoulder height, to the side of \\nthe body. \\n\\n2.13.1.4 \\n\\nall the signals in clause 2.13.1.3 are to be made by the bowler’s end umpire except that for \\nshort run, which is to be signalled by the umpire at the end where short running occurs. \\nhowever, the bowler’s end umpire shall be responsible both for the final signal of short run to \\nthe scorers and, if more than one run is short, for informing them as to the number of runs to be \\nrecorded. \\n\\n2.13.2  the umpire shall wait until each signal to the scorers has been separately acknowledged by a scorer before \\n\\nallowing play to proceed. \\n\\nif several signals are to be used, they should be given in the order that the events occurred. \\n\\n2.14 \\n\\ninforming the umpires \\n\\nwherever the umpires are to receive information from captains or other players under these playing conditions, it will \\nbe sufficient for one umpire to be so informed and for him/her to inform the other umpire. \\n\\n2.15  correctness of scores \\n\\nconsultation between umpires and scorers on doubtful points is essential. the umpires shall, throughout the match, \\nsatisfy themselves as to the correctness of the number of runs scored, the wickets that have fallen and, where \\nappropriate, the number of overs bowled. \\n\\nthe umpires shall ensure that they are able to contact the scorers at any time during the match and at its conclusion \\nto address any issues relating to the correctness of scores. \\n\\n3  the scorers \\n\\n3.1 \\n\\nappointment of scorers \\n\\ntwo scorers shall be appointed to record all runs scored, all wickets taken and, where appropriate, number of overs \\nbowled. \\n\\n3.2 \\n\\ncorrectness of scores \\n\\nthe scorers shall frequently check to ensure that their records agree and consult with the umpires if necessary. see \\nclause 2.15 (correctness of scores).

balls of an approved standard for t20i cricket and spare used \\nballs for changing during a match, which shall also be of the same brand. note: the home board shall be \\nrequired to advise the visiting board of the brand of ball to be used in the match(es) at least 30 days prior to \\nthe start of the match(es). \\n\\nthe fielding captain or his nominee may select the ball with which he wishes to bowl from the supply \\nprovided by the home board. the fourth umpire shall take a box containing at least 6 new balls to the \\ndressing room and supervise the selection of the ball. \\n\\nthe umpires shall retain possession of the match ball(s) throughout the duration of the match when play is \\nnot actually taking place. \\n\\nduring play umpires shall periodically and irregularly inspect the condition of the ball and shall retain \\npossession of it at the fall of a wicket or any other disruption in play. \\n\\n4.3 \\n\\nnew ball \\n\\n4.3.1  one new ball shall be used at the start of each innings. \\n\\n4.4 \\n\\nball lost or becoming unfit for play \\n\\nif, during play, the ball cannot be found or recovered or the umpires agree that it has become unfit for play through \\nnormal use, the umpires shall replace it with a ball which has had wear comparable with that which the previous ball \\nhad received before the need for its replacement. when the ball is replaced, the umpire shall inform the batsmen and \\nthe fielding captain. \\n\\n5  the bat \\n\\n5.1 \\n\\nthe bat \\n\\n5.1.1 \\n\\nthe bat consists of two parts, a handle and a blade. \\n\\n5.1.2 \\n\\nthe basic requirements and measurements of the bat are set out in this clause with detailed specifications in \\nparagraph 1 of appendix b. \\n\\n5.2 \\n\\nthe handle \\n\\n5.2.1 \\n\\nthe handle is to be made principally of cane and/or wood. \\n\\n5.2.2 \\n\\nthe part of the handle that is wholly outside the blade is defined to be the upper portion of the handle. it is a \\nstraight shaft for holding the bat. \\n\\n5.2.3 \\n\\nthe upper portion of the handle may be covered with a grip as defined in paragraph 1.2.2 of appendix b. \\n\\n5.3 \\n\\nthe blade \\n\\n5.3.1 \\n\\nthe blade comprises the whole of the bat apart from the handle as defined in clause 5.2 and in paragraph \\n1.3 of appendix b. \\n\\n5.3.2 \\n\\nthe blade shall consist solely of wood. \\n\\n5.4 \\n\\nprotection and repair \\n\\nsubject to the specifications in paragraph 1.4 of appendix b. and providing clause 5.5 is not contravened, \\n\\n7 \\n\\n\\x0c5.4.1 \\n\\nsolely for the purposes of \\n\\neither \\n\\nprotection from surface damage to the face, sides and shoulders of the blade \\n\\nor \\n\\nrepair to the blade after surface damage, \\n\\nmaterial that is not rigid, either at the time of its application to the blade or subsequently, may be placed on \\nthese surfaces. \\n\\n5.4.2 \\n\\nfor repair of the blade after damage other than surface damage \\n\\n5.4.2.1 \\n\\nsolid material may be inserted into the blade. \\n\\n5.4.2.2 \\n\\nthe only material permitted for any insertion is wood with minimal essential adhesives. \\n\\n5.4.3 \\n\\nto prevent damage to the toe, material may be placed on that part of the blade but shall not extend over any \\npart of the face, back or sides of the blade. \\n\\n5.5 \\n\\ndamage to the ball \\n\\n5.5.1 \\n\\n5.5.2 \\n\\n5.5.3 \\n\\nfor any part of the bat, covered or uncovered, the hardness of the constituent materials and the surface \\ntexture thereof shall not be such that either or both could cause unacceptable damage to the ball. \\n\\nany material placed on any part of the bat, for whatever purpose, shall similarly not be such that it could \\ncause unacceptable damage to the ball. \\n\\nfor the purpose of this clause, unacceptable damage is any change that is greater than normal wear and \\ntear caused by the ball striking the uncovered wooden surface of the blade. \\n\\n5.6 \\n\\ncontact with the ball \\n\\nin these clauses, \\n\\n5.6.1 \\n\\nreference to the bat shall imply that the bat is held in the batsman’s hand or a glove worn on his hand, \\nunless stated otherwise. \\n\\n5.6.2 \\n\\ncontact

size limits \\n\\n5.7.1 \\n\\nthe overall length of the bat, when the lower portion of the handle is inserted, shall not be more than 38 \\nin/96.52 cm. \\n\\n5.7.2 \\n\\nthe blade of the bat shall not exceed the following dimensions: \\n\\nwidth: 4.25in / 10.8 cm \\n\\ndepth: 2.64in / 6.7 cm \\n\\nedges: 1.56in / 4.0cm. \\n\\nfurthermore, it should also be able to pass through a bat gauge as described in paragraph 1.6 of appendix \\nb. \\n\\n5.7.3 \\n\\nthe handle shall not exceed 52% of the overall length of the bat. \\n\\n5.7.4 \\n\\nthe material permitted for covering the blade in clause 5.4.1 shall not exceed 0.04 in/0.1 cm in thickness. \\n\\n8 \\n\\n\\x0c5.7.5 \\n\\nthe maximum permitted thickness of protective material placed on the toe of the blade is 0.12 in/0.3 cm. \\n\\n5.8 \\n\\ncategories of bat \\n\\n5.8.1 \\n\\ntype a bats conform to clauses 5.1 to 5.7 inclusive. \\n\\n5.8.2  only type a bats may be used in t20i matches. \\n\\n6  the pitch \\n\\n6.1 \\n\\narea of pitch \\n\\nthe pitch is a rectangular area of the ground 22 yards/20.12 m in length and 10 ft/3.05 m in width. it is bounded at \\neither end by the bowling creases and on either side by imaginary lines, one each side of the imaginary line joining \\nthe centres of the two middle stumps, each parallel to it and 5 ft/1.52 m from it. if the pitch is next to an artificial pitch \\nwhich is closer than 5 ft/1.52 m from the middle stumps, the pitch on that side will extend only to the junction of the \\ntwo surfaces. see clauses 8.1 (description, width and pitching) and 7.2 (the bowling crease). \\n\\n6.2 \\n\\nfitness of pitch for play \\n\\nthe umpires shall be the sole judges of the fitness of the pitch for play. see clauses 2.7 (fitness for play) and 2.8 \\n(suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable conditions). \\n\\n6.3 \\n\\nselection and preparation \\n\\nbefore the match, the ground authority shall be responsible for the selection and preparation of the pitch. during the \\nmatch, the umpires shall control its use and maintenance. \\n\\n6.3.1 \\n\\n6.3.2 \\n\\nthe ground authority shall ensure that during the period prior to the start of play and during intervals, the \\npitch area shall be roped off so as to prevent unauthorised access. (the pitch area shall include an area at \\nleast 2 metres beyond the rectangle made by the crease markings at both ends of the pitch). \\n\\nthe fourth umpire shall ensure that, prior to the start of play and during any intervals, only authorised staff, \\nthe icc match officials, players, team coaches and authorised television personnel shall be allowed access \\nto the pitch area. such access shall be subject to the following limitations: \\n\\n6.3.2.1 \\n\\n6.3.2.2 \\n\\nonly captains and team coaches may walk on the actual playing surface of the pitch area \\n(outside of the crease markings). \\n\\naccess to the pitch area by television personnel shall be restricted to one camera crew \\n(including one or two television commentators) of the official licensed television broadcaster(s) \\n(but not news crews). \\n\\n6.3.2.3 \\n\\nno spiked footwear shall be permitted. \\n\\n6.3.2.4 \\n\\nno one shall be permitted to bounce a ball on the pitch, strike it with a bat or cause damage to \\nthe pitch in any other way. \\n\\n6.3.2.5 \\n\\naccess shall not interfere with pitch preparation. \\n\\n6.3.3 \\n\\nin the event of any dispute, the icc match referee will rule and his ruling will be final. \\n\\n6.4 \\n\\nchanging the pitch \\n\\n6.4.1 \\n\\nif the on-field umpires decide that it is dangerous or unreasonable for play to continue on the match pitch, \\nthey shall stop play and immediately advise the icc match referee. \\n\\n6.4.2 \\n\\nthe on-field umpires and the icc match referee shall then consult with both captains. \\n\\n6.4.3 \\n\\nif the captains agree to continue, play shall resume. \\n\\n6.4.4 \\n\\nif the decision is not to resume play, the on-field umpires together with the icc match referee shall consider \\nwhether the existing pitch can be repaired and the match resumed from the point it was stopped. in \\n\\n9 \\n\\n\\x0cconsidering whether to authorise such repairs, the icc match referee must consider whether this would \\nplace either side at an unfair advantage, given the play that had already taken place on the dangerous pitch. \\n\\n6.4.5 \\n\\nif the decision is that the existing pitch cannot be repaired, then the match is to be abandoned with the \\nfollowing consequences:  \\n\\n6.4.5.1 \\n\\nin the event of the required number of overs to constitute a match having been completed at the \\ntime the match is abandoned, the result shall be determined according to the provisions of \\nclause 16.4.2. \\n\\n6.4.5.2 \\n\\nin the event of the required number of overs to constitute a match not having been completed, \\nthe match will be abandoned as a no result. \\n\\nif the abandonment occurs on the day of the match, the icc match referee shall consult with the home \\nboard with the objective of finding a way for a new match (including a new nomination of teams and toss) to \\ncommence on the same date and venue. such a match may be played either on the repaired pitch or on \\nanother pitch, subject to the icc match referee and the relevant ground authority both being satisfied that \\nthe new pitch will be of the required t20i standard. the playing time lost between the scheduled start time of \\nthe original match and the actual start time of the new match will be covered by the provisions of clause 12. \\n\\nif it is not possible to start a new match on the scheduled day of the match, the relevant officials from the \\nparticipating boards shall agree on whether the match can be replayed within the existing tour schedule. \\n\\nthroughout the above decision making processes, the icc match referee shall keep informed both \\ncaptains and the head of the ground authority. the head of the ground authority shall ensure that suitable \\nand prompt public announcements are made. \\n\\n6.4.6 \\n\\n6.4.7 \\n\\n6.4.8 \\n\\n6.5 \\n\\nnon-turf pitches \\n\\nall t20i matches shall be played on natural turf pitches. the use of pva and other adhesives in the preparation of \\npitches is not permitted. \\n\\n7  the creases \\n\\n7.1 \\n\\nthe creases \\n\\nthe positions of a bowling crease, a popping crease and two return creases shall be marked by white lines, as set \\nout in clauses 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4, at each end of the pitch. see paragraph 1 of appendix c. \\n\\n7.2 \\n\\nthe bowling crease \\n\\nthe bowling crease, which is the back edge of the crease marking, is the line that marks the end of the pitch, as in \\nclause 6.1 (area of pitch). it shall be 8 ft 8 in/2.64 m in length. \\n\\n7.3 \\n\\nthe popping crease \\n\\nthe popping crease, which is the back edge of the crease marking, shall be in front of and parallel to the bowling \\ncrease and shall be 4 ft/1.22 m from it. the popping crease shall be marked to a minimum of 15 yards/13.71 m on \\neither side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps and shall be considered to be unlimited \\nin length. \\n\\n7.4 \\n\\nthe return creases \\n\\nthe return creases, which are the inside edges of the crease markings, shall be at right angles to the popping crease \\nat a distance of 4 ft 4 in/1.32 m either side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps. each \\nreturn crease shall be marked from the popping crease to a minimum of 8 ft/2.44 m behind it and shall be considered \\nto be unlimited in length. \\n\\n7.5 \\n\\nadditional crease markings \\n\\nas a guideline to the umpires for the calling of wides on the offside, the crease markings detailed in paragraph 1 of \\nappendix c shall be marked in white at each end of the pitch. \\n\\n10 \\n\\n\\x0c8  the wickets \\n\\n8.1 \\n\\ndescription, width and pitching \\n\\ntwo sets of wickets shall be pitched opposite and parallel to each other in the centres of the bowling creases. each \\nset shall be 9 in/22.86 cm wide and shall consist of three wooden stumps with two wooden bails on top. see \\nparagraph 2 of appendix b. \\n\\n8.2 \\n\\nsize of stumps \\n\\nthe tops

from the domed top, with \\ncircular section of diameter not less than 1.38 in/3.50 cm nor more than 1.5 in/3.81 cm. see paragraph 2 of appendix \\nb. \\n\\nfor televised matches the home board may provide a slightly larger cylindrical stump to accommodate the stump \\ncamera. when the larger stump is used, all three stumps must be exactly the same size. \\n\\n8.3 \\n\\nthe bails \\n\\n8.3.1 \\n\\nthe bails, when in position on top of the stumps, \\n\\n- shall not project more than 0.5 in/1.27 cm above them. \\n\\n- shall fit between the stumps without forcing them out of the vertical. \\n\\n8.3.2 \\n\\neach bail shall conform to the following specifications (see paragraph 2 of appendix b). \\n\\noverall length 4.31 in/10.95 cm \\n\\nlength of barrel 2.13 in /5.40 cm \\n\\nlonger spigot 1.38 in/3.50 cm \\n\\nshorter spigot 0.81 in/2.06 cm. \\n\\n8.3.3 \\n\\nthe two spigots and the barrel shall have the same centre line. \\n\\n8.3.4 \\n\\ndevices aimed at protecting player safety by limiting the distance that a bail can travel off the stumps will be \\nallowed, subject to the approval of the home board and the icc. \\n\\n8.4 \\n\\ndispensing with bails \\n\\nthe umpires may agree to dispense with the use of bails, if necessary. if they so agree then no bails shall be used at \\neither end. the use of bails shall be resumed as soon as conditions permit. see clause 29.4 (dispensing with bails). \\n\\n8.5 \\n\\nled wickets \\n\\nthe use of approved led wickets is permitted. refer also to paragraphs 3.8.1.6 and 4.2 of appendix d. \\n\\n9  preparation and

innings. \\n\\n11 \\n\\n\\x0c9.1.2 \\n\\nrolling after a delayed start \\n\\nin addition to the rolling permitted above, if, after the toss and before the first innings of the match, the start \\nis delayed, the captain of the batting side may request that the pitch be rolled for not more than 7 minutes. \\nhowever, if the umpires together agree that the delay has had no significant effect on the state of the pitch, \\nthey shall refuse such request for rolling of the pitch. \\n\\n9.1.3 \\n\\nchoice of rollers \\n\\nif there is more than one roller available the captain of the batting side shall choose which one is to be used. \\n\\nthe following shall apply in addition to clause 9.1: \\n\\n9.1.4 \\n\\nprior to the scheduled time for the toss, the artificial drying of the pitch and outfield shall be at the discretion \\nof the ground authority. thereafter and throughout the match the drying of the outfield may be undertaken \\nat any time by the ground authority, but the drying of the affected area of the pitch shall be carried out only \\non the instructions and under the supervision of the umpires. the umpires shall be empowered to have the \\npitch dried without reference to the captains at any time they are of the opinion that it is unfit for play. \\n\\n9.1.5 \\n\\nthe umpires may instruct the ground authority to use any available equipment, including any roller for the \\npurpose of drying the pitch and making it fit for play. \\n\\n9.1.6 \\n\\nan absorbent roller may be used to remove water from the covers including the cover on the match pitch. \\n\\n9.2 \\n\\nclearing debris from the pitch \\n\\n9.2.1 \\n\\nthe pitch shall be cleared of any debris \\n\\n9.2.1.1 \\n\\nbetween innings. this shall precede rolling if any is to take place. \\n\\n9.2.2 \\n\\nthe clearance of debris in clause 9.2.1 shall be done by sweeping, except where the umpires consider that \\nthis may be detrimental to the surface of the pitch. in this case the debris must be cleared from that area by \\nhand, without sweeping. \\n\\n9.2.3 \\n\\nin addition to clause 9.2.1, debris may be cleared from the pitch by hand, without sweeping, before mowing \\nand whenever either umpire considers it necessary. \\n\\n9.3  mowing \\n\\n9.3.1 \\n\\nresponsibility for mowing \\n\\n9.3.1.1 \\n\\nall mowings which are carried out before the match shall be the sole responsibility of the \\nground authority. \\n\\n9.4  watering the pitch \\n\\nthe pitch shall not be watered during the match. \\n\\n9.5 \\n\\nre-marking creases \\n\\ncreases shall be re-marked whenever either umpire

play. \\n\\nthe umpires shall allow, if necessary, the returfing of footholes made by the bowlers in their delivery strides, or the \\nuse of quick-setting fillings for the same purpose. \\n\\nin addition, the umpires shall see that wherever possible and whenever it is considered necessary, action is taken \\nduring all intervals in play to do whatever is practicable to improve the bowler’s footholes.  \\n\\n12 \\n\\n\\x0c9.7 \\n\\nsecuring of footholds and maintenance of pitch \\n\\nduring play, umpires shall allow the players to secure their footholds by the use of sawdust provided that no damage \\nto the pitch is caused and that clause 41 (unfair play) is not contravened. \\n\\n9.8 \\n\\nprotection and preparation of adjacent pitches during matches \\n\\nthe protection (by way of an appropriate cover) and preparation of pitches which are adjacent to the match pitch will \\nbe permitted during the match subject to the following: \\n\\n9.8.1 \\n\\n9.8.2 \\n\\nsuch measures will only be possible if requested by the ground authority and approved by the umpires \\nbefore the start of the match. \\n\\napproval should only be granted where such measures are unavoidable and will not compromise the safety \\nof the players or their ability to execute their actions with complete freedom. \\n\\n9.8.3 \\n\\nthe preparation work shall be carried out under the supervision of the fourth umpire. \\n\\n9.8.4 \\n\\nthe consent of the captains is not required but the umpires shall advise both captains and the icc match \\nreferee before the start of the match on what has been agreed. \\n\\n10 covering the pitch \\n\\n10.1  before the match \\n\\nthe use of covers before the match is the responsibility of the ground authority and may include full covering if \\nrequired. \\n\\nthe pitch shall be entirely protected against rain up to the commencement of play. \\n\\nhowever, the ground authority shall grant suitable facility to the captains to inspect the pitch before the nomination of \\ntheir players and to the umpires to discharge their duties as laid down in clauses 2 (the umpires), 6 (the pitch), 7 \\n(the creases), 8 (the wickets), and 9 (preparation and maintenance of the playing area). \\n\\n10.2  during the match \\n\\nthe pitch shall be entirely protected against rain up to the commencement of play, and for the duration of the period \\nof the match. \\n\\nthe covers must totally protect the pitch and also the pitch surroundings, to a minimum of 5 metres either side of the \\npitch, and any worn or soft areas in the outfield. \\n\\nthe bowlers’ run-ups shall be covered during inclement weather, in order to keep them dry, to a distance of at least \\n10 x 10 metres. \\n\\n10.3  removal of covers \\n\\nall covers (including “hessian”

completed prior to the scheduled time for the interval, the interval \\nshall take place immediately and the innings of the team batting second will commence correspondingly \\nearlier.  in circumstances where the side bowling first has not completed the allotted number of overs by the \\nscheduled or re-scheduled cessation time for the first innings, the umpires shall reduce the length of the \\ninterval by the amount of time that the first innings over-ran. the minimum time for the interval will be 10 \\nminutes.  \\n\\n11.4.2  however, following a lengthy delay or interruption prior to the completion of the innings of the team batting \\nfirst, the match referee may, at his discretion, reduce the interval between innings from 20 minutes to not \\nless than 10 minutes.  \\n\\n11.4.3  such discretion should only be exercised after determining the adjusted overs per side based on a 20 \\n\\nminute interval. if having exercised this discretion, the rescheduled finishing time for the match is earlier than \\nthe latest possible finishing time, then these minutes should be deducted from the length of any interruption \\nduring the second innings before determining the overs remaining.  \\n\\n11.5 \\n\\nintervals for drinks \\n\\n11.5.1  no drinks intervals shall be permitted. \\n\\n11.5.2  an individual player may be given a drink either on the boundary edge or at

removal of bails \\n\\nafter the call of time, the bails shall be removed from both wickets. \\n\\n12.4  starting a new over \\n\\nanother over shall always be started at any time during the match, unless an interval is to be taken in the \\ncircumstances set out in clause 12.5.2, if the umpire, walking at normal pace, has arrived at the position behind the \\nstumps at the bowler’s end before the time agreed for the next interval has been reached. \\n\\n14 \\n\\n\\x0c12.5  completion of an over \\n\\nother than at the end of the match, \\n\\n12.5.1 \\n\\nif the agreed time for an interval is reached during an over, the over shall be completed before the interval is \\ntaken, except as provided for in clause 12.5.2. \\n\\n12.5.2  when less than 3 minutes remains before the time agreed for the next interval, the interval shall be taken \\n\\nimmediately if \\n\\neither a batsman is dismissed or retires, or \\n\\nthe players have occasion to leave the field, \\n\\nwhether this occurs during an over or at the end of an over. except at the end of an innings, if an over is \\nthus interrupted it shall be completed on the resumption of play. \\n\\n12.6  conclusion of match \\n\\n12.6.1  the match is concluded \\n\\n12.6.1.1 \\n\\nas soon as a result as defined in clauses 16.1 to 16.5 (the result) is reached. \\n\\n12.6.1.2 \\n\\nas soon as the prescribed number of overs have been completed \\n\\n12.6.2  the match is concluded if, without a conclusion having been reached under 12.6.1, the players leave the \\n\\nfield for adverse conditions of ground, weather or light, or in exceptional circumstances, and no further play \\nis possible. \\n\\n12.7  hours of play; minimum overs requirement \\n\\n12.7.1  to be determined by the home board subject to there being 2 sessions of 1 hour 25 minutes each, \\n\\nseparated by a 20 minute interval between innings.  \\n\\n12.8  minimum over rates \\n\\n12.8.1  the minimum over rate to be achieved in t20i matches shall be 14.11 overs per hour. \\n\\n12.8.2  the actual over rate shall be calculated at the end of each innings by the umpires. \\n\\n12.8.3 \\n\\nin calculating the actual over rate for the match, allowances shall be given as follows: \\n\\n12.8.3.1 \\n\\nthe time lost as a result of treatment given to a player by an authorised medical personnel on \\nthe field of play; \\n\\n12.8.3.2 \\n\\nthe time lost as a result of a player being required to leave the field as a result of a serious \\ninjury; \\n\\n12.8.3.3 \\n\\nthe time taken for all third umpire referrals and consultations and any umpire or player reviews; \\n\\n12.8.3.4 \\n\\nthe time lost as a result of time wasting by the batting side; and \\n\\n12.8.3.5 \\n\\nthe time lost due to all other circumstances that are beyond the control of the fielding side. \\n\\n12.8.4 \\n\\nin the event of any time allowances being granted to the fielding team under clause 12.8.3.4 above (time \\nwasting by batting team), then such time shall be deducted from the allowances granted to such batting \\nteam in the determination of its over rate. \\n\\n12.8.5 \\n\\nin addition to the allowances as provided for above, \\n\\n12.8.5.1 \\n\\nin the case of an innings that has been reduced due to any delay or interruption in play, an \\nadditional allowance of 1 minute for every full 3 overs by which the innings is reduced will be \\ngranted. \\n\\n12.8.5.2 \\n\\nan additional allowance of 1 minute will be given for each of the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th wickets \\ntaken during an innings. \\n\\n15 \\n\\n\\x0c12.8.6 \\n\\nif a batting team is bowled out within the time determined for that innings pursuant to these playing \\nconditions (taking into account all of the time allowances set out above), the fielding side shall

\\neither team has to be revised to a lesser number than originally allotted (minimum of 5 overs), \\nthen a revised target score (to win) should be set for the number of overs which the team batting \\nsecond will have the opportunity of facing. this revised target is to be calculated using the \\ncurrent duckworth/lewis/stern method. the target set will always be a whole number and one \\nrun less will constitute a tie.

dimension shall be exempt. in such cases the boundary shall be positioned so as to \\nmaximize the size of the playing area. \\n\\n19.2 \\n\\nidentifying and marking the boundary \\n\\n19.2.1  all boundaries must be designated by a rope, or similar object of a minimum standard as authorised by the \\nicc from time to time. the rope should be positioned a required minimum distance (3 yards (2.74 metres) \\nminimum) inside the perimeter fencing or advertising signs, or from any solid object located between the \\nrope and the fence/signs. for grounds with a large playing area, the maximum length of boundary should be \\nused before applying the minimum 3 yards (2.74 metres) between the boundary and the fence. \\n\\n19.2.2 \\n\\nif the boundary is marked by means of an object that is in contact with the ground the boundary will be the \\nedge of the grounded part of the object which is nearest the pitch. \\n\\n19.2.3  an obstacle within the field of play shall not be regarded as a boundary unless so determined by the umpires \\n\\nbefore the toss. see clause 2.3.4 (consultation with home board). \\n\\n19.2.4 \\n\\nif an unauthorized person enters the playing arena and handles the ball, the umpire at the bowler’s end shall \\nbe the sole judge of whether the boundary allowance should be scored or the ball be treated as still in play \\nor called dead ball if a batsman is liable to be out as a result of the unauthorized person handling the ball. \\n\\n19.3  restoring the boundary \\n\\nif a solid object used to mark the boundary is disturbed for any reason, then: \\n\\n19.3.1 \\n\\nthe boundary shall be considered to be in its original position. \\n\\n19.3.2 \\n\\nthe object shall be returned to its original position as soon as is practicable; if play is taking place, this shall \\nbe as soon as the ball is dead. \\n\\n19.3.3 \\n\\nif some part of a fence or other marker has come within the field of play, that part shall be removed from the \\nfield of play as soon as is practicable; if play is taking place, this shall be as soon as the ball is dead. \\n\\n19.4  ball grounded beyond the boundary \\n\\n19.4.1  the ball in play is grounded beyond the boundary if it touches \\n\\n25 \\n\\n\\x0c- the boundary or any part of an object used to mark the boundary; \\n\\n- the ground beyond the boundary; \\n\\n- any object that is grounded beyond the boundary. \\n\\n19.4.2  the ball in play is to be regarded as being grounded beyond the boundary if \\n\\n- a fielder, grounded beyond the boundary as in clause 19.5, touches the ball; \\n\\n- a fielder, after catching the ball within the boundary, becomes grounded beyond the boundary while in \\ncontact with the ball, before completing the catch. \\n\\n19.5  fielder grounded beyond the boundary \\n\\n19.5.1  a fielder is grounded beyond the boundary if some part of his person is in contact with any of the following: \\n\\n- the boundary or any part of an object used to mark the boundary; \\n\\n- the ground beyond the boundary; \\n\\n- any object that is in contact with the ground beyond the boundary; \\n\\n- another fielder who is grounded beyond the boundary. \\n\\n19.5.2  a fielder who is not in contact with the ground is considered to be grounded beyond the boundary if his final \\n\\ncontact with the ground, before his first contact with the ball after it has been delivered by the bowler, was \\nnot entirely within the boundary. \\n\\n19.6  boundary allowances \\n\\n19.6.1  6 runs shall be allowed for a boundary 6; and 4 runs for a boundary 4. see also clause 19.7. \\n\\n19.7  runs scored from boundaries \\n\\n19.7.1  a boundary 6 will be scored if and only if the ball has been struck by the bat and is first grounded beyond the \\n\\nboundary without having been in contact with the ground within the field of play. this shall apply even if the \\nball has previously touched a fielder. \\n\\n19.7.2  a boundary 4 will be scored when a ball that is grounded beyond the boundary \\n\\n- whether struck by the bat or not, was first grounded within the boundary, or \\n\\n- has not been struck by the bat. \\n\\n19.7.3  when a boundary is scored, the batting side, except in the circumstances of clause 19.8, shall be awarded \\n\\nwhichever is the greater of \\n\\n19.7.3.1 \\n\\nthe allowance for the boundary \\n\\n19.7.3.2 \\n\\nthe runs completed by the batsmen together with the run in progress if they had already crossed \\nat the instant the boundary is scored. \\n\\n19.7.4  when the runs in clause 19.7.3.2 exceed the boundary allowance they shall replace the boundary allowance \\n\\nfor the purposes of clause 18.12. \\n\\n19.7.5  the scoring of penalty runs by either side is not affected by the scoring of a boundary. \\n\\n19.8  overthrow or wilful act of fielder \\n\\nif the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be \\n\\nany runs for penalties awarded to either side \\n\\nand the allowance for the boundary \\n\\n26 \\n\\n\\x0cand the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of \\nthe throw or act. \\n\\nclause 18.12.2 (batsman returning to wicket he has left) shall apply as from the instant of the throw or act. \\n\\n20 dead ball \\n\\n20.1  ball is dead \\n\\n20.1.1  the ball becomes dead when \\n\\n20.1.1.1 \\n\\nit is finally settled in the hands of the wicket-keeper or of the bowler. \\n\\n20.1.1.2 \\n\\na boundary is scored. see clause 19.7 (runs scored from boundaries). \\n\\n20.1.1.3 \\n\\na batsman is dismissed. the ball will be deemed to be dead from the instant of the incident \\ncausing the dismissal. \\n\\n20.1.1.4 \\n\\nwhether played or not it becomes trapped between the bat and person of a batsman or between \\nitems of his clothing or equipment. \\n\\n20.1.1.5 \\n\\nwhether played or not it lodges in the clothing or equipment of a batsman or the clothing of an \\numpire. \\n\\n20.1.1.6 \\n\\nthere is an award of penalty runs under either of clauses 24.4 (player returning without \\npermission) or 28.2 (fielding the ball). the ball shall not count as one of the over. \\n\\n20.1.1.7 \\n\\nthere is a contravention of clause 28.3 (protective helmets belonging to the fielding side). \\n\\n20.1.1.8 \\n\\nthe match is concluded in any of the ways stated in clause 12.6 (conclusion of match). \\n\\n20.1.2  the ball shall be considered to be dead when it is clear to the bowler’s end umpire that the fielding side and \\n\\nboth batsmen at the wicket have ceased to regard it as in play. \\n\\n20.1.3 \\n\\nin a match where cameras are being used on or over the field of play (e.g. spidercam), should a ball that \\nhas been hit by the batsman make contact, while still in play, with the camera, its apparatus or its cable, \\neither umpire shall call and signal ‘dead ball’. the ball shall not count as one of the over and no runs shall be \\nscored. if the delivery was called a no ball it shall count and the no ball penalty shall be applied. no other \\nruns (including penalty runs) apart from the no ball penalty shall be scored. \\n\\n20.1.4  should a ball thrown by a fielder make contact with a camera on or over the field of play, its apparatus or its \\ncable, either umpire shall call and signal dead ball. unless this was already a no ball or wide, the ball shall \\ncount as one of the over. all runs scored to that point shall count, plus the run in progress if the batsmen \\nhave already crossed. \\n\\n20.1.5  refer also to paragraph 2.6 of appendix d. \\n\\n20.2  ball finally settled \\n\\nwhether the ball is finally settled or not is a matter for the umpire alone to decide. \\n\\n20.3  call of over or time \\n\\nneither the call of over (see clause 17.4), nor the call of time (see clause 12.2) is to be made until the ball is dead, \\neither under clauses 20.1 or 20.4. \\n\\n20.4  umpire calling and signalling dead ball \\n\\n20.4.1  when the ball has become dead under clause 20.1, the bowler’s end umpire may call and signal dead ball if \\n\\nit is necessary to inform the players. \\n\\n20.4.2  either umpire shall call and signal dead ball when \\n\\n20.4.2.1 \\n\\nintervening in a case of unfair play. \\n\\n27 \\n\\n\\x0c20.4.2.2 \\n\\na possibly serious injury to a player or umpire occurs. \\n\\n20.4.2.3 \\n\\nleaving his/her normal position for consultation. \\n\\n20.4.2.4 \\n\\none or both bails fall from the striker’s wicket before the striker has had the opportunity of \\nplaying the ball. \\n\\n20.4.2.5 \\n\\n20.4.2.6 \\n\\n20.4.2.7 \\n\\nthe striker is not ready for the delivery of the ball and, if the ball is delivered, makes no attempt \\nto play it. provided the umpire is satisfied that the striker had adequate reason for not being \\nready, the ball shall not count as one of the over. \\n\\nthe striker is distracted by any noise or movement or in any other way while preparing to \\nreceive, or receiving a delivery. this shall apply whether the source of the distraction is within \\nthe match or outside it. note also clause 20.4.2.7. the ball shall not count as one of the over. \\n\\nthere is an instance of a deliberate attempt to distract under either of clauses 41.4 (deliberate \\nattempt to distract striker) or 41.5 (deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batsman). \\nthe ball shall not count as one of the over. \\n\\n20.4.2.8 \\n\\nthe bowler drops the ball accidentally before delivery. \\n\\n20.4.2.9 \\n\\nthe ball does not leave the bowler’s hand for any reason other than an attempt to run out the \\nnon-striker under clause 41.16 (non-striker leaving his ground early). \\n\\n20.4.2.10 \\n\\nsatisfied that the ball in play cannot be recovered. \\n\\n20.4.2.11 \\n\\nrequired to do so under any of the playing conditions not included above. \\n\\n20.5  ball ceases to be dead \\n\\nthe ball ceases to be dead – that is, it comes into play – when the bowler starts his run-up or, if there is no run-up, \\nstarts his bowling action. \\n\\n20.6  dead ball; ball counting as one of over \\n\\n20.6.1  when a ball which has been delivered is called dead or is to be considered dead then, other than as in \\n\\nclause 20.6.2, \\n\\n20.6.1.1 \\n\\nit will not count in the over if the striker has not had an opportunity to play it. \\n\\n20.6.1.2 \\n\\nunless no ball or wide ball has been called, it will be a valid ball if the striker has had an \\nopportunity to play it, except in the circumstances of clauses 20.4.2.6 and 24.4 ( player \\nreturning without permission), 28.2 (fielding the ball), 41.4 (deliberate attempt to distract striker) \\nand 41.5 (deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batsman). \\n\\n20.6.2 \\n\\nin clause 20.4.2.5, the ball will not count in the over only if both conditions of not attempting to play the ball \\nand having an adequate reason for not being ready are met. otherwise the delivery will be a valid ball. \\n\\n21 no ball \\n\\n21.1  mode of delivery \\n\\n21.1.1  the umpire shall ascertain whether the bowler intends to bowl right handed or left handed, over or round the \\n\\nwicket, and shall so inform the striker. \\n\\nit is unfair if the bowler fails to notify the umpire of a change in his mode of delivery. in this case the umpire \\nshall call and signal no ball. \\n\\n21.1.2  underarm bowling shall not be permitted. \\n\\n21.2  fair delivery – the arm \\n\\nfor a delivery to be fair in respect of the arm the ball must not be delivered with an illegal bowling action. \\n\\n28 \\n\\n\\x0can illegal bowling action is defined as a bowling action where a bowler’s elbow extension exceeds 15 degrees, \\nmeasured from the point at which the bowling arm reaches the horizontal until the point at which the ball is released \\n(any elbow hyperextension shall be discounted for the purposes of determining an illegal bowling action). \\n\\nshould either umpire or the icc match referee suspect that a bowler has used an illegal bowling action, they shall \\ncomplete the icc bowling action report form at the conclusion of the match, as set out in the illegal bowling \\nregulations. \\n\\n21.3  ball thrown or delivered underarm – action by umpires \\n\\n21.3.1 \\n\\nif, in the opinion of either umpire, the ball has been thrown (where such mode of delivery does not \\ncorrespond to the bowler’s normal bowling action) or delivered underarm, he/she shall call and signal no ball \\nand, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. \\n\\nthe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\n\\n- warn the bowler, indicating that this is a first and final warning. this warning shall apply to that bowler \\nthroughout the innings. \\n\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. \\n\\n- inform the batsmen at the wicket of what has occurred. \\n\\n21.3.2 \\n\\nif either umpire considers that, in that innings, a further delivery by the same bowler is thrown (where such \\nmode of delivery does not correspond to the bowler’s normal bowling action) or delivered underarm, he/she \\nshall call and signal no ball and when the ball is dead inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. \\n\\nthe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\n\\n- direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling. the over shall, if \\napplicable, be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled the previous over or part thereof \\nnor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. the bowler thus suspended shall not bowl again in that \\ninnings. \\n\\n- inform the batsmen at the wicket and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the reason \\nfor this action. \\n\\n21.3.3  the umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the icc match \\n\\nreferee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\n\\n21.4  bowler throwing towards striker’s end before delivery \\n\\nif the bowler throws the ball towards the striker’s end before entering the delivery stride, either umpire shall call and \\nsignal no ball. see clause 41.17 (batsmen stealing a run). \\n\\nhowever, the procedure stated in clause 21.3 of caution, informing, final warning, action against the bowler and \\nreporting shall not apply. \\n\\n21.5  fair delivery – the feet \\n\\nfor a delivery to be fair in respect of the feet, in the delivery stride \\n\\n21.5.1 \\n\\nthe bowler’s back foot must land within and not touching the return crease appertaining to his stated mode of \\ndelivery. \\n\\n21.5.2 \\n\\nthe bowler’s front foot must land with some part of the foot, whether grounded or raised \\n\\n- on the same side of the imaginary line joining the two middle stumps as the return crease described in \\nclause 21.5.1, and \\n\\n- behind the popping crease. \\n\\nif the bowler’s end umpire is satisfied that any of these three conditions have not been met, he/she shall call and \\nsignal no ball. see clause 41.8 (bowling of deliberate front foot no ball). \\n\\n29 \\n\\n\\x0c21.6  bowler breaking wicket in delivering ball \\n\\neither umpire shall call and signal no ball if, other than in an attempt to run out the non-striker under clause 41.16, \\nthe bowler breaks the wicket at any time after the ball comes into play and before completion of the stride after the \\ndelivery stride. this shall include any clothing or other object that falls from his person and breaks the wicket. \\n\\n21.7  ball bouncing more than once, rolling along the ground or pitching off the pitch \\n\\nthe umpire shall call and signal no ball if a ball which he/she considers to have been delivered, without having \\npreviously touched bat or person of the striker, \\n\\n- bounces more than once \\n\\n- or rolls along the ground before it reaches the popping crease. \\n\\n- or pitches wholly or partially off the pitch as defined in clause 6.1 (area of pitch) before it reaches the line of the \\nstriker’s wicket. \\n\\n21.8  ball coming to rest in front of striker’s wicket \\n\\nif a ball delivered by the bowler comes to rest in front of the line of the striker’s wicket, without having previously \\ntouched the bat or person of the striker, the umpire shall call and signal no ball and immediately call and signal dead \\nball. \\n\\n21.9  fielder intercepting a delivery \\n\\nif, except in the circumstances of clause 27.3 (position of wicket-keeper) a ball delivered by the bowler, makes \\ncontact with any part of a fielder’s person before it either makes contact with the striker’s bat or person, or it passes \\nthe striker’s wicket, the umpire shall call and signal no ball and immediately call and signal dead ball. \\n\\n21.10  ball bouncing over head height of striker \\n\\nsee clauses 22.1.1.2 and 41.6.1.7. \\n\\n21.11  call of no ball for infringement of other playing conditions \\n\\nin addition to the instances above, no ball is to be called and signalled as required by the following clauses: \\n\\n clause 27.3 – position of wicket-keeper \\n\\n clause 28.4 – limitation of on side fielders \\n\\n clause 28.5 – fielders not to encroach on pitch \\n\\n clause 41.6 – bowling of dangerous and unfair short pitched deliveries \\n\\n clause 41.7 – bowling of dangerous and unfair non-pitching deliveries \\n\\n clause 41.8 – bowling of deliberate front foot no ball. \\n\\n21.12  revoking a call of no ball \\n\\nan umpire shall revoke the call of no ball if dead ball is called under any of clauses 20.4.2.4 to 20.4.2.9 (umpire \\ncalling and signaling dead ball). \\n\\n21.13  no ball to over-ride wide \\n\\na call of no ball shall over-ride the call of wide ball at any time. see clauses 22.1(judging a wide) and 22.2 (call and \\nsignal of wide ball). \\n\\n21.14  ball not dead \\n\\nthe ball does not become dead on the call of no ball. \\n\\n30 \\n\\n\\x0c21.15  penalty for a no ball \\n\\na penalty of one run shall be awarded instantly on the call of no ball. unless the call is revoked, the penalty shall \\nstand even if a batsman is dismissed. it shall be in addition to any other runs scored, any boundary allowance and \\nany other runs awarded for penalties. \\n\\n21.16  runs resulting from a no ball – how scored \\n\\nthe one run penalty shall be scored as a no ball extra and shall be debited against the bowler. if other penalty runs \\nhave been awarded to either side these shall be scored as stated in clause 41.18 (penalty runs). any runs completed \\nby the batsmen or any boundary allowance shall be credited to the striker if the ball has been struck by the bat; \\notherwise they shall also be scored as byes or leg byes as appropriate. \\n\\n21.17  no ball not to count \\n\\na no ball shall not count as one of the over. see clause 17.3 (validity of balls). \\n\\n21.18  out from a no ball \\n\\nwhen no ball has been called, neither batsman shall be out under any of the playing conditions except clause 34 \\n(hit the ball twice), clause 37 (obstructing the field) or clause 38 (run out). \\n\\n21.19  free hit  \\n\\n21.19.1  in addition to the above, the delivery following a no ball called (all modes of no ball) shall be a free hit for \\n\\nwhichever batsman is facing it. if the delivery for the free hit is not a legitimate delivery (any kind of no ball \\nor a wide) then the next delivery will become a free hit for whichever batsman is facing it.  \\n\\n21.19.2  for any free hit, the striker can be dismissed only under the circumstances that apply for a no ball, even if \\n\\nthe delivery for the free hit is called wide.  \\n\\n21.19.3  neither field changes nor the exchange of individuals between fielding positions are permitted for free hit \\n\\ndeliveries unless: \\n\\n21.19.3.1  there is a change of striker (the provisions of clause 41.2 shall apply), or \\n\\n21.19.3.2  the no ball was the result of a fielding restriction breach, in which case the field may be \\n\\nchanged to the extent of correcting the breach. \\n\\n21.19.4  for clarity, the bowler can change his mode of delivery for the free hit delivery. in such circumstances \\n\\nclause 21.1 shall apply. \\n\\n21.19.5  the umpires will signal a free hit by (after the normal no ball signal) extending one arm straight upwards and \\n\\nmoving it in a circular motion. \\n\\n22 wide ball \\n\\n22.1  judging a wide \\n\\n22.1.1 \\n\\nif the bowler bowls a ball, not being a no ball, the umpire shall adjudge it a wide if, according to the \\ndefinition in clause 22.1.2 \\n\\n22.1.1.1 \\n\\nthe ball passes wide of where the striker is standing and which also would have passed wide of \\nthe striker standing in a normal guard position. \\n\\n22.1.1.2 \\n\\nthe ball passes above the head height of the striker standing upright at the popping crease. \\n\\n22.1.2  the ball will be considered as passing wide of the striker unless it is sufficiently within reach for him to be \\n\\nable to hit it with the bat by means of a normal cricket stroke. \\n\\n22.1.3  umpires are instructed to apply very strict and consistent interpretation in regard to this clause in order to \\n\\nprevent negative bowling wide of the wicket. \\n\\n31 \\n\\n\\x0c22.2  call and signal of wide ball \\n\\nif the umpire adjudges a delivery to be a wide he/she shall call and signal wide ball as soon as the ball passes the \\nstriker’s wicket. it shall, however, be considered to have been a wide from the instant that the bowler entered his \\ndelivery stride, even though it cannot be called wide until it passes the striker’s wicket. \\n\\n22.3  revoking a call of wide ball \\n\\n22.3.1  the umpire shall revoke the call of wide ball if there is then any contact between the ball and the striker’s \\n\\nbat or person before the ball comes into contact with any fielder. \\n\\n22.3.2  the umpire shall revoke the call of wide ball if a delivery is called a no ball. see clause 21.13 (no ball to \\n\\nover-ride wide). \\n\\n22.4  delivery not a wide \\n\\n22.4.1  the umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a wide, if the striker, by moving, either causes the ball to \\n\\npass wide of him, as defined in clause 22.1.2 or brings the ball sufficiently within reach to be able to hit it by \\nmeans of a normal cricket stroke. \\n\\n22.4.2  the umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a wide if the ball touches the striker’s bat or person, but \\n\\nonly as the ball passes the striker. \\n\\n22.5  ball not dead \\n\\nthe ball does not become dead on the call of wide ball. \\n\\n22.6  penalty for a wide \\n\\na penalty of one run shall be awarded instantly on the call of wide ball. unless the call is revoked, see clause 22.3, \\nthis penalty shall stand even if a batsman is dismissed, and shall be in addition to any other runs scored, any \\nboundary allowance and any other runs awarded for penalties. \\n\\n22.7  runs resulting from a wide – how scored \\n\\nall runs completed by the batsmen or a boundary allowance, together with the penalty for the wide, shall be scored \\nas wide balls. apart from any award of 5 penalty runs, all runs resulting from a wide shall be debited against the \\nbowler. \\n\\n22.8  wide not to count \\n\\na wide shall not count as one of the over. see clause 17.3 (validity of balls). \\n\\n22.9  out from a wide \\n\\nwhen wide ball has been called, neither batsman shall be out under any of the playing conditions except clause 35 \\n(hit wicket), clause 37 (obstructing the field), clause 38 (run out) or clause 39 (stumped). \\n\\n23 bye and leg bye \\n\\n23.1  byes \\n\\nif the ball, delivered by the bowler, not being a wide, passes the striker without touching his bat or person, any runs \\ncompleted by the batsmen from that delivery, or a boundary allowance, shall be credited as byes to the batting side. \\nadditionally, if the delivery is a no ball, the one run penalty for such a delivery shall be incurred. \\n\\n23.2  leg byes \\n\\n23.2.1 \\n\\nif a ball delivered by the bowler first strikes the person of the striker, runs shall be scored only if the umpire \\nis satisfied that the striker has \\n\\neither attempted to play the ball with the bat \\n\\n32 \\n\\n\\x0cor tried to avoid being hit by the ball. \\n\\n23.2.2 \\n\\nif the umpire is satisfied that either of these conditions has been met runs shall be scored as follows. \\n\\n23.2.2.1 \\n\\nif there is \\n\\neither no subsequent contact with the striker’s bat or person, or \\n\\nonly inadvertent contact with the striker’s bat or person \\n\\nany runs completed by the batsmen or a boundary allowance shall be credited to the striker in \\nthe case of subsequent contact with his bat but otherwise to the batting side as in clause 23.2.3. \\n\\n23.2.2.2 \\n\\nif the striker wilfully makes a lawful second strike, clause 34.3 (ball lawfully struck more than \\nonce) and clause 34.4 (runs permitted from ball lawfully struck more than once) shall apply. \\n\\n23.2.3  the runs in clause 23.2.2.1, unless credited to the striker, shall be scored as leg byes. \\n\\nadditionally, if the delivery is a no ball, the one run penalty for the no ball shall be incurred. \\n\\n23.3  leg byes not to be awarded \\n\\nif in the circumstance of clause 23.2.1 the umpire considers that neither of the conditions therein has been met, then \\nleg byes shall not be awarded. \\n\\nif the ball does not become dead for any other reason, the umpire shall call and signal dead ball as soon as the ball \\nreaches the boundary or at the completion of the first run. \\n\\nthe umpire shall then: \\n\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side; \\n\\n- return any not out batsman to his original end; \\n\\n- signal no ball to the scorers if applicable; \\n\\n- award any 5-run penalty that is applicable except for penalty runs under clause 28.3 (protective helmets belonging \\nto the fielding side). \\n\\n24 fielder’s absence; substitutes \\n\\n24.1  substitute fielders \\n\\n24.1. shall allow a substitute fielder \\n\\n24.1.1.1 \\n\\nif they are satisfied that a fielder has been injured or become ill and that this occurred during the \\nmatch, or \\n\\n24.1.1.2 \\n\\nfor any other wholly acceptable reason. \\n\\nin all other circumstances, a substitute is not allowed. \\n\\n24.1.2  a substitute shall not bowl or act as captain but may act as wicket-keeper only with the consent of the \\n\\numpires. note, however, clause 42.4.1. \\n\\n24.1.3  a nominated player may bowl or field even though a substitute has previously acted for him, subject to \\n\\nclauses 24.2 and 24.3. \\n\\n24.1.4  squad members of the fielding or batting team who are not playing in the match and who are not acting as \\n\\nsubstitute fielders shall be required to wear a team training bib whilst on the playing area (including the area \\nbetween the boundary and the perimeter fencing). \\n\\n33 \\n\\n\\x0c24.2  fielder absent or leaving the field of play \\n\\n24.2.1  a player going briefly outside the boundary while carrying out any duties as a fielder is not absent from the \\n\\nfield of play nor, for the purposes of this clause, is he to be regarded as having left the field of play. \\n\\n24.2.2 \\n\\nif a fielder fails to take the field at the start of play or at any later time, or leaves the field during play, \\n\\n24.2.2.1 \\n\\nan umpire shall be informed of the reason for this absence. \\n\\n24.2.2.2 \\n\\nhe shall not thereafter come on to the field of play during a session of play without the consent \\nof the umpire. see clause 24.4. the umpire shall give such consent as soon as it is practicable. \\n\\n24.2.3 \\n\\nif a player is absent from the field for longer than 8 minutes, the following restrictions shall apply to their \\nfuture participation in the match: \\n\\n24.2.3.1 \\n\\n24.2.3.2 \\n\\nthe player shall not be permitted to bowl in the match until he has either been able to field, or \\nhis team has subsequently been batting, for the total length of playing time for which the player \\nwas absent (hereafter referred to as penalty time). a player’s unexpired penalty time shall be \\nlimited to a maximum of 40 minutes. if any unexpired penalty time remains at the end of an \\ninnings, it is carried forward to the next and subsequent innings of the match. \\n\\nthe player shall not be permitted to bat in the match until his team’s batting innings has been in \\nprogress for the length of playing time that is equal to the unexpired penalty time carried \\nforward from the previous innings. however, once his side has lost five wickets in its batting \\ninnings, he may bat immediately. if any unexpired penalty time remains at the end of that batting \\ninnings, it is carried forward to the next and subsequent innings of the match. \\n\\n24.2.4 \\n\\nif the player leaves the field before having served all of his penalty time, the balance is carried forward as \\nunserved penalty time. \\n\\n24.2.5  on any occasion of absence, the amount of playing time for which the player is off the field shall be added to \\n\\nany penalty time that remains unserved, subject to a maximum cumulative penalty time of 40 minutes, and \\nthat player shall not bowl until all of his penalty time has been served. \\n\\n24.2.6  for the purposes of clauses 24.2.3.1 and 24.2.3.2, playing time shall comprise the time play is in progress \\n\\nexcluding intervals between innings. for clarity, a player’s penalty time will continue to expire after he is \\ndismissed, for the remainder of his team’s batting innings. \\n\\n24.2.7 \\n\\nif there is an unscheduled break in play, the stoppage time shall count as penalty time served, provided that, \\n\\n24.2.7.1 \\n\\nthe fielder who was on the field of play at the start of the break either takes the field on the \\nresumption of play, or his side is now batting. \\n\\n24.2.7.2 \\n\\nthe fielder who was already off the field at the start of the break notifies an umpire in person as \\nsoon as he is able to participate, and either takes the field on the resumption of play, or his side \\nis now batting. stoppage time before an umpire has been so notified shall not count towards \\nunserved penalty time. \\n\\n24.2.8  any unserved penalty time shall be carried forward into the next innings of the match, as applicable. \\n\\n24.3  penalty time not incurred \\n\\na nominated player’s absence will not incur penalty time if, \\n\\n24.3.1  he has suffered an external blow during the match and, as a result, has justifiably left the field or is unable to \\n\\ntake the field. \\n\\n24.3.2 \\n\\nin the opinion of the umpires, the player has been absent or has left the field for other wholly acceptable \\nreasons, which shall not include illness or internal injury. \\n\\n24.3.3 \\n\\nthe player is absent from the field for a period of 8 minutes or less. \\n\\n34 \\n\\n\\x0c24.4  player returning without permission \\n\\nif a player comes on to the field of play in contravention of clause 24.2.2 and comes into contact with the ball while it \\nis in play, the ball shall immediately become dead. \\n\\n- the umpire shall award 5 penalty runs to the batting side. \\n\\n- runs completed by the batsmen shall be scored together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the \\ninstant of the offence. \\n\\n- the ball shall not count as one of the over. \\n\\n- the umpire shall inform the other umpire, the captain of the fielding side, the batsmen and, as soon as practicable, \\nthe captain of the batting side of the reason for this action. \\n\\n25 batsman’s innings \\n\\n25.1  eligibility to act as a batsman \\n\\nonly a nominated player may bat and, subject to clause 25.3, may do so even though a substitute fielder has \\npreviously acted for him. \\n\\n25.2  commencement of a batsman’s innings \\n\\nthe innings of the first two batsmen, and that of any new batsman on the resumption of play after a call of time, shall \\ncommence at the call of play. at any other time, a batsman’s innings shall be considered to have commenced when \\nthat batsman first steps onto the field of play. \\n\\n25.3  restriction on batsman commencing an innings \\n\\n25.3.1 \\n\\nif a member of the batting side has unserved penalty time, (see clause 24.2.7), that player shall not be \\npermitted to bat until that penalty time has been served. however, even if the unserved penalty time has not \\nexpired, that player may bat after his side has lost 5 wickets. \\n\\n25.3.2  a member of the batting side’s penalty time is served during playing time. in the event of an unscheduled \\n\\nstoppage, the stoppage time after the batsman notifies an umpire in person that he is able to participate \\nshall count as penalty time served.  \\n\\n25.4  batsman retiring \\n\\n25.4.1  a batsman may retire at any time during his innings when the ball is dead. the umpires, before allowing play \\n\\nto proceed, shall be informed of the reason for a batsman retiring. \\n\\n25.4.2 \\n\\nif a batsman retires because of illness, injury or any other unavoidable cause, that batsman is entitled to \\nresume his innings. if for any reason this does not happen, that batsman is to be recorded as ‘retired - not \\nout’. \\n\\n25.4.3 \\n\\nif a batsman retires for any reason other than as in clause 25.4.2, the innings of that batsman may be \\nresumed only with the consent of the opposing captain. if for any reason his innings is not resumed, that \\nbatsman is to be recorded as ‘retired - out’. \\n\\n25.4.4 \\n\\nif after retiring a batsman resumes his innings, subject to the requirements of clauses 25.4.2 and 25.4.3, it \\nshall be only at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of another batsman. \\n\\n25.5  runners \\n\\nrunners shall not be permitted. \\n\\n35 \\n\\n\\x0c26 practice on the field \\n\\n26.1  practice on the pitch or the rest of the square \\n\\n26.1.1  there shall not be any practice on the pitch at any time. \\n\\n26.1.2  there shall not be any practice on the rest of the square at any time except with the approval of the umpires. \\n\\n26.1.2.1 \\n\\n26.1.2.2 \\n\\nif approved by the umpires, the use of the square for practice on any day of any match will be \\nrestricted to any netted practice area or bowling strips specifically prepared on the edge of the \\nsquare for that purpose. \\n\\nbowling practice on the bowling strips referred to above shall also be permitted during the \\ninterval (and change of innings if not the interval) unless the umpires consider that, in the \\nprevailing conditions of ground and weather, it will be detrimental to the surface of the square. \\n\\n26.2  practice on the outfield \\n\\n26.2.1  on any day of the match, all forms of practice are permitted on the outfield \\n\\n- before the start of play; \\n\\n- after the close of play; and \\n\\n- during the interval or between innings \\n\\nproviding the umpires are satisfied that such practice will not cause significant deterioration in the condition \\nof the outfield. \\n\\n26.2.2  between the call of play and the call of time, practice shall be permitted on the outfield, providing that all of \\n\\nthe following conditions are met: \\n\\n- only the fielders as defined in paragraph 7 of appendix a participate in such practice. \\n\\n- no ball other than the match ball is used for this practice. \\n\\n- no bowling practice takes place in the area between the square and the boundary in a direction parallel to \\nthe match pitch. \\n\\n- the umpires are satisfied that it will not contravene either of clauses 41.3 (the match ball changing its \\ncondition) or 41.9 (time wasting by the fielding side). \\n\\nbowling a ball, using a short run up to a player in the outfield is not to be regarded as bowling practice but \\nshall be subject to the other conditions in this clause. \\n\\n26.3  trial run-up \\n\\na bowler is permitted to have a trial run-up provided the umpire is satisfied that it will not contravene either of clauses \\n41.9 (time wasting by the fielding side) or 41.12 (fielder damaging the pitch). \\n\\n26.4  penalties for contravention \\n\\nall forms of practice are subject to the provisions of clauses 41.3 (the match ball – changing its condition), 41.9 \\n(time wasting by the fielding side) and 41.12 (fielder damaging the pitch). \\n\\n26.4.1 \\n\\nif there is a contravention of any of the provisions of clause 26.1 or 26.2, the umpire shall \\n\\n- warn the player that the practice is not permitted; \\n\\n- inform the other umpire and, as soon as practicable, both captains of the reason for this action. \\n\\n26.4.1.1 \\n\\nif the contravention is by a batsman at the wicket, the umpire shall inform the other batsman \\nand each incoming batsman that the warning has been issued. the warning shall apply to the \\nteam of that player throughout the match. \\n\\n36 \\n\\n\\x0c26.4.2 \\n\\nif during the match there is any further contravention by any player of that team, the umpire shall \\n\\n- award 5 penalty runs to the opposing side; \\n\\n- inform the other umpire, the scorers and, as soon as practicable, both captains, and, if the contravention is \\nduring play, the batsmen at the wicket. \\n\\n27 the wicket-keeper \\n\\n27.1  protective equipment \\n\\nthe wicket-keeper is the only fielder permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards. if these are worn, they are to \\nbe regarded as part of his person for the purposes of clause 28.2 (fielding the ball). if by the wicket-keeper’s actions \\nand positioning when the ball comes into play it is apparent to the umpires that he will not be able to carry out the \\nnormal duties of a wicket-keeper, he shall forfeit this right and also the right to be recognised as a wicket-keeper for \\nthe purposes of clauses 33.2 (a fair catch), 39 (stumped), 28.1 (protective equipment), 28.4 (limitation of on-side \\nfielders) and 28.5 (fielders not to encroach on pitch). \\n\\n27.2  gloves \\n\\n27.2.1 \\n\\nif, as permitted under clause 27.1, the wicket-keeper wears gloves, they shall have no webbing between the \\nfingers except joining index finger and thumb, where webbing may be inserted as a means of support. \\n\\n27.2.2 \\n\\nif used, the webbing shall be a single piece of non-stretch material which, although it may have facing \\nmaterial attached, shall have no reinforcements or tucks. \\n\\n27.2.3  the top edge of the webbing shall not protrude beyond the straight line joining the top of the index finger to \\n\\nthe top of the thumb and shall be taut when a hand wearing the glove has the thumb fully extended. see \\nparagraph 3 of appendix b. \\n\\n27.3  position of wicket-keeper \\n\\n27.3.1  the wicket-keeper shall remain wholly behind the wicket at the striker’s end from the moment the ball comes \\n\\ninto play until a ball delivered by the bowler \\n\\ntouches the bat or person of the striker; or \\n\\npasses the wicket at the striker’s end; or \\n\\nthe striker attempts a run. \\n\\n27.3.2 \\n\\nin the event of the wicket-keeper contravening this clause, the striker’s end umpire shall call and signal no \\nball as soon as applicable after the delivery of the ball. \\n\\n27.4  movement by wicket-keeper \\n\\n27.4.1  after the ball comes into play and before it reaches the striker, it is unfair if the wicket-keeper significantly \\n\\nalters his position in relation to the striker’s wicket, except for the following: \\n\\n27.4.1.1  movement of a few paces forward for a slower delivery, unless in so doing it brings him within \\n\\nreach of the wicket. \\n\\n27.4.1.2 \\n\\nlateral movement in response to the direction in which the ball has been delivered. \\n\\n27.4.1.3  movement in response to the stroke that the striker is playing or that his actions suggest he \\n\\nintends to play. however the provisions of clause 27.3 shall apply. \\n\\n27.4.2 \\n\\nin the event of unfair movement by the wicket-keeper, either umpire shall call and signal dead ball. \\n\\n27.5  restriction on actions of wicket-keeper \\n\\nif, in the opinion of either umpire, the wicket-keeper interferes with the striker’s right to play the ball and to guard his \\nwicket, clause 20.4.2.6 (umpire calling and signalling dead ball) shall apply. \\n\\n37 \\n\\n\\x0cif, however, either umpire considers that the interference by the wicket-keeper was wilful, then clause 41.1 \\n(deliberate attempt to distract striker) shall also apply. \\n\\n27.6 \\n\\ninterference with wicket-keeper by striker \\n\\nif, in playing at the ball or in the legitimate defence of his wicket, the striker interferes with the wicket-keeper, he shall \\nnot be out except as provided for in clause 37.3 (obstructing a ball from being caught). \\n\\n28 the fielder \\n\\n28.1  protective equipment \\n\\nno fielder other than the wicket-keeper shall be permitted to wear gloves or external leg guards. in addition, \\nprotection for the hand or fingers may be worn only with the consent of the umpires. \\n\\n28.2  fielding the ball \\n\\n28.2.1  a fielder may field the ball with any part of his person (see paragraph 12 of appendix a), except as in clause \\n\\n28.2.1.2. however, he will be deemed to have fielded the ball illegally if, while the ball is in play he wilfully \\n\\n28.2.1.1 \\n\\nuses anything other than part of his person to field the ball. \\n\\n28.2.1.2 \\n\\nextends his clothing with his hands and uses this to field the ball. \\n\\n28.2.1.3 \\n\\ndiscards a piece of clothing, equipment or any other object which subsequently makes contact \\nwith the ball. \\n\\n28.2.2 \\n\\nit is not illegal fielding if the ball in play makes contact with a piece of clothing, equipment or any other object \\nwhich has accidentally fallen from the fielder’s person. \\n\\n28.2.3 \\n\\nif a fielder illegally fields the ball, the ball shall immediately become dead and \\n\\n- the penalty for a no ball or a wide shall stand. \\n\\n- any runs completed by the batsmen shall be credited to the batting side, together with the run in progress if \\nthe batsmen had already crossed at the instant of the offence. \\n\\n- the ball shall not count as one of the over. \\n\\nin addition the umpire shall: \\n\\n- award 5 penalty runs to the batting side. \\n\\n- inform the other umpire and the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. \\n\\n- inform the batsmen and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. \\n\\n28.3  protective helmets belonging to the fielding side \\n\\n28.3.1  protective helmets, when not in use by fielders, may not be placed on the ground, above the surface except \\n\\nbehind the wicket-keeper and in line with both sets of stumps. \\n\\n28.3.2 \\n\\nif the ball while in play strikes a helmet, placed as described in clause 28.3.1, \\n\\n28.3.2.1 \\n\\nthe ball shall become dead \\n\\nand, subject to clause 28.3.3, \\n\\n28.3.2.2 \\n\\nan award of 5 penalty runs shall be made to the batting side; \\n\\n28.3.2.3 \\n\\nany runs completed by the batsmen before the ball strikes the protective helmet shall be scored, \\ntogether with the run in progress if the batsmen had already crossed at the instant of the ball \\nstriking the protective helmet. \\n\\n38 \\n\\n\\x0c28.3.3 \\n\\nif the ball while in play strikes a helmet, placed as described in clause 28.3.1, unless the circumstances of \\nclause 23.3 (leg byes not to be awarded) or clause 34 (hit the ball twice), apply, the umpire shall: \\n\\n- permit the batsmen’s runs as in clause 28.3.2.3 to be scored \\n\\n- signal no ball or wide ball to the scorers if applicable \\n\\n- award 5 penalty runs as in clause 28.3.2.2 \\n\\n- award any other penalty runs due to the batting side. \\n\\n28.3.4 \\n\\nif the ball while in play strikes a helmet, placed as described in clause 28.3.1, and the circumstances of \\nclause 23.3 (leg byes not to be awarded) or clause 34 (hit the ball twice) apply, the umpire shall: \\n\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\n\\n- return any not out batsman to his original end \\n\\n- signal no ball or wide ball to the scorers if applicable \\n\\n- award any 5-run penalty that is applicable except for penalty runs under clause 28.3.2. \\n\\n28.4  limitation of on side fielders \\n\\n28.4.1  at the instant of delivery, there may not be more than 5 fielders on the leg side. \\n\\n28.4.2  at the instant of the bowler’s delivery there shall not be more than two fielders, other than the wicket-keeper, \\n\\nbehind the popping crease on the on side. a fielder will be considered to be behind the popping crease \\nunless the whole of his person whether grounded or in the air is in front of this line. \\n\\n28.4.3 \\n\\nin the event of infringement of this clause by any fielder, the striker’s end umpire shall call and signal no \\nball. \\n\\n28.5  fielders not to encroach on pitch \\n\\nwhile the ball is in play and until the ball has made contact with the striker’s bat or person, or has passed the striker’s \\nbat, no fielder, other than the bowler, may have any part of his person grounded on or extended over the pitch. \\n\\nin the event of infringement of this clause by any fielder other than the wicket-keeper, the bowler’s end umpire shall \\ncall and signal no ball as soon as possible after delivery of the ball. note, however, clause 27.3 (position of wicket-\\nkeeper). \\n\\n28.6  movement by any fielder other than the wicket-keeper \\n\\n28.6.1  any movement by any fielder, excluding the wicket-keeper, after the ball comes into play and before the ball \\n\\nreaches the striker, is unfair except for the following: \\n\\n28.6.1.1  minor adjustments to stance or position in relation to the striker’s wicket. \\n\\n28.6.1.2  movement by any fielder, other than a close fielder, towards the striker or the striker’s wicket \\n\\nthat does not significantly alter the position of the fielder. \\n\\n28.6.1.3  movement by any fielder in response to the stroke that the striker is playing or that his actions \\n\\nsuggest he intends to play. \\n\\n28.6.2 \\n\\nin all circumstances clause 28.4 (limitation of on side fielders) shall apply. \\n\\n28.6.3 \\n\\nin the event of such unfair movement, either umpire shall call and signal dead ball. \\n\\n28.6.4  note also the provisions of clause 41.4 (deliberate attempt to distract striker). see also clause 27.4 \\n\\n(movement by wicket-keeper). \\n\\n39 \\n\\n\\x0c28.7  restrictions on the placement of fielders  \\n\\n28.7.1 \\n\\nin addition to the restrictions contained in clause 28.4 above, further fielding restrictions shall apply to certain \\novers in each innings. the nature of such fielding restrictions and the overs during which they shall apply are \\nset out in the following paragraphs.  \\n\\n28.7.2  subject to 28.7.6 below these additional fielding restrictions shall apply to the first 6 overs of each innings \\n\\n(powerplay overs). \\n\\n28.7.3  two semi-circles shall be drawn on the field of play. the semi-circles shall have as their centre the middle \\n\\nstump at either end of the pitch. the radius of each of the semi-circles shall be 30 yards (27.43 metres). the \\nsemi-circles shall be linked by two parallel straight lines drawn on the field (see paragraph 2 of appendix c). \\nthese fielding restriction areas should be marked by continuous painted white lines or ‘dots’ at 5 yard (4.57 \\nmetres) intervals, each ‘dot’ to be covered by a white plastic or rubber (but not metal) disc measuring 7 \\ninches (18 cm) in diameter.  \\n\\n28.7.4  during the powerplay overs only two fielders shall be permitted outside this fielding restriction area at the \\n\\ninstant of delivery.  \\n\\n28.7.5  during the non powerplay overs, no more than 5 fielders shall be permitted outside the fielding restriction \\n\\narea referred to in clause 28.7.3 above. \\n\\n28.7.6 \\n\\nin circumstances when the number of overs of the batting team is reduced, the number of powerplay overs \\nshall be reduced in accordance with the table below. for the sake of clarity, it should be noted that the table \\nshall apply to both the 1st and 2nd innings of the match.  \\n\\ntotal overs in innings \\n\\n5-8 \\n9-11 \\n12-14 \\n15-18 \\n19-20 \\n\\nnumber of overs for which fielding restrictions in clauses 28.7.2 and \\n28.7.4 above will apply \\n2 \\n3 \\n4 \\n5 \\n6 \\n\\n \\n\\n28.7.7 \\n\\nif an innings is interrupted during an over and if on the resumption of play, due to the reduced number of \\novers of the batting team, the required number of powerplay overs have already been bowled, the remaining \\ndeliveries in the over to be completed shall not be subject to the fielding restrictions. \\n\\n28.7.8 \\n\\nin the event of an infringement of any of the above fielding restrictions, the square leg umpire shall call and \\nsignal no ball. \\n\\n29 the wicket is down \\n\\n29.1  wicket put down \\n\\n29.1.1  the wicket is put down if a bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps, or a stump is struck out of \\n\\nthe ground, \\n\\n29.1.1.1 \\n\\nby the ball, \\n\\n29.1.1.2 \\n\\nby the striker’s bat if held or by any part of the bat that he is holding, \\n\\n29.1.1.3 \\n\\nfor the purpose of this clause only, by the striker's bat not in hand, or by any part of the bat \\nwhich has become detached, \\n\\n29.1.1.4 \\n\\nby the striker’s person or by any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached from his \\nperson, \\n\\n29.1.1.5 \\n\\nby a fielder with his hand or arm, providing that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or \\nin the hand of the arm so used. \\n\\n40 \\n\\n\\x0c29.1.1.6 \\n\\nthe wicket is also put down if a fielder strikes or pulls a stump out of the ground in the same \\nmanner. \\n\\n29.1.2  the disturbance of a bail, whether temporary or not, shall not constitute its complete removal from the top of \\n\\nthe stumps, but if a bail in falling lodges between two of the stumps this shall be regarded as complete \\nremoval. \\n\\n29.2  one bail off \\n\\nif one bail is off, it shall be sufficient for the purpose of putting the wicket down to remove the remaining bail or to \\nstrike or pull any of the three stumps out of the ground, in any of the ways stated in clause 29.1. \\n\\n29.3  remaking wicket \\n\\nif a wicket is broken or put down while the ball is in play, it shall not be remade by an umpire until the ball is dead. \\nsee clause 20 (dead ball). any fielder may, however, while the ball is in play, \\n\\n- replace a bail or bails on top of the stumps. \\n\\n- put back one or more stumps into the ground where the wicket originally stood. \\n\\n29.4  dispensing with bails \\n\\nif the umpires have agreed to dispense with bails in accordance with clause 8.5 (dispensing with bails), it is for the \\numpire concerned to decide whether or not the wicket has been put down. \\n\\n29.4.1  after a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been put down if the umpire concerned is satisfied that \\n\\nthe wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker’s bat, person or items of his clothing or equipment as \\ndescribed in clauses 29.1.1.2, 29.1.1.3 or 29.1.1.4, or by a fielder in the manner described in clause \\n29.1.1.5. \\n\\n29.4.2 \\n\\nif the wicket has already been broken or put down, clause 29.4.1 shall apply to any stump or stumps still in \\nthe ground. any fielder may replace a stump or stumps, in accordance with clause 29.3, in order to have an \\nopportunity of putting the wicket down. \\n\\n30 batsman out of his ground \\n\\n30.1  when out of his ground \\n\\n30.1.1  a batsman shall be considered to be out of his ground unless some part of his person or bat is grounded \\n\\nbehind the popping crease at that end. \\n\\n30.1.2  however, a batsman shall not be considered to be out of his ground if, in running or diving towards his \\n\\nground and beyond, and having grounded some part of his person or bat beyond the popping crease, there \\nis subsequent loss of contact \\n\\nbetween the ground and any part of his person or bat, or \\n\\nbetween the bat and person, \\n\\nprovided that the batsman has continued movement in the same direction. \\n\\n30.2  which is a batsman’s ground \\n\\n30.2.1 \\n\\nif only one batsman is within a ground, it is his ground and will remain so even if he is later joined there by \\nthe other batsman. \\n\\n30.2.2 \\n\\nif both batsmen are in the same ground and one of them subsequently leaves it, the ground belongs to the \\nbatsman who remains in it. \\n\\n30.2.3 \\n\\nif there is no batsman in either ground, then each ground belongs to whichever batsman is nearer to it, or, if \\nthe batsmen are level, to whichever batsman was nearer to it immediately prior to their drawing level. \\n\\n41 \\n\\n\\x0c30.2.4 \\n\\nif a ground belongs to one batsman then the other ground belongs to the other batsman, irrespective of his \\nposition. \\n\\n30.3  position of non-striker \\n\\nthe non-striker, when standing at the bowler’s end, should be positioned on the opposite side of the wicket to that \\nfrom which the ball is being delivered, unless a request to do otherwise is granted by the umpire. \\n\\n31 appeals \\n\\n31.1  umpire not to give batsman out without an appeal \\n\\nneither umpire shall give a batsman out, even though he may be out under these playing conditions, unless \\nappealed to by a fielder. this shall not debar a batsman who is out under these playing conditions from leaving the \\nwicket without an appeal having been made. note, however, the provisions of clause 31.7. \\n\\n31.2  batsman dismissed \\n\\na batsman is dismissed if he is \\n\\neither given out by an umpire, on appeal \\n\\nor out under these playing conditions and leaves the wicket as in clause 31.1. \\n\\n31.3  timing of appeals \\n\\nfor an appeal to be valid, it must be made before the bowler begins his run-up or, if there is no run-up, his bowling \\naction to deliver the next ball, and before time has been called. \\n\\nthe call of over does not invalidate an appeal made prior to the start of the following over, provided time has not \\nbeen called. see clauses 12.2 (call of time) and 17.2 (start of an over). \\n\\n31.4  appeal “how’s that?” \\n\\nan appeal “how’s that?” covers all ways of being out. \\n\\n31.5  answering appeals \\n\\nthe striker’s end umpire shall answer all appeals arising out of any of clauses 35 (hit wicket), 39 (stumped) or 38 \\n(run out) when this occurs at the wicket-keeper’s end. the bowler’s end umpire shall answer all other appeals. \\n\\nwhen an appeal is made, each umpire shall answer on any matter that falls within his jurisdiction. \\n\\nwhen a batsman has been given not out, either umpire may answer an appeal, made in accordance with clause \\n31.3, if it is on a further matter and is within his jurisdiction. \\n\\n31.6  consultation by umpires \\n\\neach umpire shall answer appeals on matters within his own jurisdiction. if an umpire is doubtful about any point that \\nthe other umpire may have been in a better position to see, he/she shall consult the latter on this point of fact and \\nshall then give the decision. if, after consultation, there is still doubt remaining, the decision shall be not out. \\n\\n31.7  batsman leaving the wicket under a misapprehension \\n\\nan umpire shall intervene if satisfied that a batsman, not having been given out, has left the wicket under a \\nmisapprehension of being out. the umpire intervening shall call and signal dead ball to prevent any further action by \\nthe fielding side and shall recall the batsman. \\n\\na batsman may be recalled at any time up to the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery, unless it \\nis the final wicket of the innings, in which case it should be up to the instant when the umpires leave the field. \\n\\n42 \\n\\n\\x0c31.8  withdrawal of an appeal \\n\\nthe captain of the fielding side may withdraw an appeal only after obtaining the consent of the umpire within whose \\njurisdiction the appeal falls. if such consent is given, the umpire concerned shall, if applicable, revoke the decision \\nand recall the batsman. \\n\\nthe withdrawal of an appeal must be before the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery or, if the \\ninnings has been completed, the instant when the umpires leave the field. \\n\\n32 bowled \\n\\n32.1  out bowled \\n\\n32.1.1  the striker is out bowled if his wicket is put down by a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a no ball, even \\n\\nif it first touches the striker’s bat or person. \\n\\n32.1.2  however, the striker shall not be out bowled if before striking the wicket the ball has been in contact with any \\nother player or an umpire. the striker will, however, be subject to clauses 37 (obstructing the field), 38 (run \\nout) and 39 (stumped). \\n\\n32.2  bowled to take precedence \\n\\nthe striker is out bowled if his wicket is put down as in clause 32.1, even though a decision against him for any other \\nmethod of dismissal would be justified. \\n\\n33 caught \\n\\n33.1  out caught \\n\\nthe striker is out caught if a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a no ball, touches his bat without having \\npreviously been in contact with any fielder, and is subsequently held by a fielder as a fair catch, as described in \\nclause 33.2 and 33.3, before it touches the ground. \\n\\n33.2  a fair catch \\n\\n33.2.1  a catch will be fair only if, in every case \\n\\neither the ball, at any time \\n\\nor any fielder in contact with the ball, \\n\\nis not grounded beyond the boundary before the catch is completed. note clauses 19.4 (ball grounded \\nbeyond the boundary) and 19.5 (fielder grounded beyond the boundary). \\n\\n33.2.2  furthermore, a catch will be fair if any of the following conditions applies: \\n\\n33.2.2.1 \\n\\nthe ball is held in the hand or hands of a fielder, even if the hand holding the ball is touching the \\nground, or is hugged to the body, or lodges in the external protective equipment worn by a \\nfielder, or lodges accidentally in a fielder’s clothing. \\n\\n33.2.2.2 \\n\\na fielder catches the ball after it has been lawfully struck more than once by the striker, but only \\nif it has not been grounded since it was first struck. see clause 34 (hit the ball twice). \\n\\n33.2.2.3 \\n\\na fielder catches the ball after it has touched the wicket, an umpire, another fielder or the other \\nbatsman. \\n\\n33.2.2.4 \\n\\na fielder catches the ball after it has crossed the boundary in the air, provided that the conditions \\nin clause 33.2.1 are met. \\n\\n33.2.2.5 \\n\\nthe ball is caught off an obstruction within the boundary that is not designated a boundary by the \\numpires. \\n\\n43 \\n\\n\\x0c33.3  making a catch \\n\\nthe act of making a catch shall start from the time when the ball first comes into contact with a fielder’s person and \\nshall end when a fielder obtains complete control over both the ball and his own movement. \\n\\n33.4  no runs to be scored \\n\\nif the striker is dismissed caught, runs from that delivery completed by the batsmen before the completion of the \\ncatch shall not be scored but any runs for penalties awarded to either side shall stand. clause 18.11.1 (batsman \\nreturning to original end) shall apply from the instant of the completion of the catch. \\n\\n33.5  caught to take precedence \\n\\nif the criteria of clause 33.1 are met and the striker is not out bowled, then he is out caught, even though a decision \\nagainst either batsman for another method of dismissal would be justified. \\n\\n34 hit the ball twice \\n\\n34.1  out hit the ball twice \\n\\n34.1.1  the striker is out hit the ball twice if, while the ball is in play, it strikes any part of his person or is struck by \\nhis bat and, before the ball has been touched by a fielder, the striker wilfully strikes it again with his bat or \\nperson, other than a hand not holding the bat, except for the sole purpose of guarding his wicket. see clause \\n34.3 and clause 37 (obstructing the field). \\n\\n34.1.2  for the purpose of this clause ‘struck’ or ‘strike’ shall include contact with the person of the striker. \\n\\n34.2  not out hit the ball twice \\n\\nthe striker will not be out under this clause if he \\n\\n34.2.1  strikes the ball a second or subsequent time in order to return the ball to any fielder.  \\n\\nnote, however, the provisions of clause 37.4 (returning the ball to a fielder). \\n\\n34.2.2  wilfully strikes the ball after it has touched a fielder. note, however the provisions of clause 37.1 (out \\n\\nobstructing the field). \\n\\n34.3  ball lawfully struck more than once \\n\\nthe striker may, solely in order to guard his wicket and before the ball has been touched by a fielder, lawfully strike \\nthe ball a second or subsequent time with the bat, or with any part of his person other than a hand not holding the \\nbat. \\n\\nhowever, the striker may not prevent the ball from being caught by striking the ball more than once in defence of his \\nwicket. see clause 37.3 (obstructing a ball from being caught). \\n\\n34.4  runs permitted from ball lawfully struck more than once \\n\\nwhen the ball is lawfully struck more than once, as permitted in clause 34.3, if the ball does not become dead for any \\nreason, the umpire shall call and signal dead ball as soon as the ball reaches the boundary or at the completion of \\nthe first run. however, the umpire shall delay the call of dead ball to allow the opportunity for a catch to be \\ncompleted. \\n\\nthe umpire shall \\n\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\n\\n- return any not out batsman to his original end \\n\\n- signal no ball to the scorers if applicable; and \\n\\n44 \\n\\n\\x0c- award any 5-run penalty that is applicable except for penalty runs under clause 28.3 (protective helmets belonging \\nto the fielding side). \\n\\n34.5  bowler does not get credit \\n\\nthe bowler does not get credit for the wicket. \\n\\n35 hit wicket \\n\\n35.1  out hit wicket \\n\\n35.1.1  the striker is out hit wicket if, after the bowler has entered the delivery stride and while the ball is in play, his \\n\\nwicket is put down by either the striker’s bat or person as described in clauses 29.1.1.2 to 29.1.1.4 (wicket \\nput down) in any of the following circumstances: \\n\\n35.1.1.1 \\n\\nin the course of any action taken by him in preparing to receive or in receiving a delivery, \\n\\n35.1.1.2 \\n\\nin setting off for the first run immediately after playing or playing at the ball, \\n\\n35.1.1.3 \\n\\nif no attempt is made to play the ball, in setting off for the first run, providing that in the opinion \\nof the umpire this is immediately after the striker has had the opportunity of playing the ball, \\n\\n35.1.1.4 \\n\\nin lawfully making a second or further stroke for the purpose of guarding his wicket within the \\nprovisions of clause 34.3 (ball lawfully struck more than once). \\n\\n35.1.2 \\n\\nif the striker puts his wicket down in any of the ways described in clauses 29.1.1.2 to 29.1.1.4 before the \\nbowler has entered the delivery stride, either umpire shall call and signal dead ball. \\n\\n35.2  not out hit wicket \\n\\nthe striker is not out under this clause should his wicket be put down in any of the ways referred to in clause 35.1 if \\nany of the following applies: \\n\\n- it occurs after the striker has completed any action in receiving the delivery, other than in clauses 35.1.1.2 to \\n35.1.1.4. \\n\\n- it occurs when the striker is in the act of running, other than setting off immediately for the first run. \\n\\n- it occurs when the striker is trying to avoid being run out or stumped. \\n\\n- it occurs when the striker is trying to avoid a throw in at any time. \\n\\n- the bowler after entering the delivery stride does not deliver the ball. in this case either umpire shall immediately call \\nand signal dead ball. see clause 20.4 (umpire calling and signalling dead ball). \\n\\n- the delivery is a no ball. \\n\\n36 leg before wicket \\n\\n36.1  out lbw \\n\\nthe striker is out lbw if all the circumstances set out in clauses 36.1.1 to 36.1.5 apply. \\n\\n36.1.1  the bowler delivers a ball, not being a no ball \\n\\n36.1.2 \\n\\nthe ball, if it is not intercepted full-pitch, pitches in line between wicket and wicket or on the off side of the \\nstriker’s wicket \\n\\n36.1.\""
