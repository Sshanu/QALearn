	\item {\fontsize{9pt}{10.8pt}\selectfont Subject to weather conditions the Super Over will take place on the scheduled day of the match at a time to be determined by the ICC Match Referee. In normal circumstances it shall commence 10 minutes after the conclusion of the match.\par}\par

Should play be delayed prior to or during the Super Over once the playing time lost exceeds the extra time allocated, the Super Over shall be abandoned. See paragraph 16 below.\par}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
	\item {\fontsize{9pt}{10.8pt}\selectfont The Super Over shall take place on the pitch allocated for the match (the designated pitch) unless otherwise determined by the umpires in consultation with the Ground Authority and the ICC Match Referee.\par}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
	\item {\fontsize{9pt}{10.8pt}\selectfont The umpires shall stand at the same end as that in which they finished the match.\par}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
	\item {\fontsize{9pt}{10.8pt}\selectfont In both innings of the Super Over, the fielding side shall choose from which end to bowl.\par}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
	\item {\fontsize{9pt}{10.8pt}\selectfont Only nominated players in the match may participate in the Super Over. Should any player (including the batsmen and bowler) be unable to continue to participate in the Super Over due to injury, illness or other wholly acceptable reasons, the relevant Playing Conditions as they apply in the match shall also apply in the Super Over.\par}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
	\item {\fontsize{9pt}{10.8pt}\selectfont Any penalty time being served in the match shall be carried forward to the Super Over.\par}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
	\item {\fontsize{9pt}{10.8pt}\selectfont Each teamâ€™s over is played with the same fielding restrictions as apply for the last over in a match played under the ICC Twenty20 International Playing Conditions.\par}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
	\item {\fontsize{9pt}{10.8pt}\selectfont The team batting second in the match shall bat first in the Super Over.\par}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
	\item {\fontsize{9pt}{10.8pt}\selectfont The captain of the fielding team (or his/her nominee) shall select the ball with which the fielding team shall bowl their over in the Super Over from the box of spare balls provided by the umpires (which shall include the balls used in the match, but no new balls). The team fielding first in the Super Over shall have first choice of ball. The team fielding second may choose to use the same ball as chosen by the team bowling first. If the ball needs to be changed, the Playing Conditions shall apply.\par}\par
